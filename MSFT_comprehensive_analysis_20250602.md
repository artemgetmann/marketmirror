## 2. Recent News

**Investment in Switzerland**

On June 2, 2025, Microsoft announced a $400 million investment to enhance its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure in Switzerland. This initiative includes expanding and upgrading four data centers near Geneva and Zurich to meet the growing demand for AI and cloud services. The expansion aims to keep data within Swiss borders, addressing critical needs in sectors like healthcare, finance, and government. Additionally, Microsoft plans to collaborate more closely with small and medium-sized enterprises and offer training programs to improve AI and digital tool proficiency.

**Russian Subsidiary Bankruptcy**

On May 30, 2025, it was reported that Microsoft's Russian subsidiary, Microsoft Rus LLC, intends to file for bankruptcy. This decision follows increasing restrictions from Russian authorities, including President Vladimir Putin's push to replace foreign service providers like Microsoft with domestic alternatives. Microsoft had previously begun scaling down operations in Russia in June 2022 due to economic changes and the impact of the Ukraine conflict.

**FTC Drops Activision Blizzard Case**

On May 22, 2025, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) dropped its legal challenge against Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The FTC had initially argued that the merger could harm competition, particularly in the Xbox console market and in subscription and cloud-based gaming. After losing an appeal earlier in May 2025 to block the deal, the FTC concluded that continuing the case was not in the public interest. Microsoft views the FTC's withdrawal as validation of the acquisition and a win for both gamers and practical policymaking.

**Developer Conference Focus on AI**

In May 2025, Microsoft hosted its annual developer conference in Seattle, emphasizing the monetization of its significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI). The company has invested $64 billion in 2025, primarily to support AI services like Copilot in Microsoft 365. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the goal of cost efficiency in AI by optimizing algorithms for better performance. Demand for AI services within Microsoft's Azure cloud continues to rise, and the company is focusing on using its own data centers for core services while turning to specialized providers for additional computing needs.

**Workforce Reduction**

On May 13, 2025, Microsoft announced plans to lay off approximately 7,000 employees, representing about 3% of its workforce. These job cuts span various levels and geographies and are part of Microsoft's effort to control costs while investing heavily in artificial intelligence. Despite strong financial performance, including better-than-expected growth in its Azure cloud business, Microsoft is taking steps to maintain profit margins amid broader economic uncertainty.

## 3. Historical Valuation

Microsoft's current Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 35.53. Examining historical data, the company's P/E ratios at year-end from 2019 to 2024 are as follows:

- **2019**: 28.35
- **2020**: 34.25
- **2021**: 37.15
- **2022**: 29.50
- **2023**: 31.80
- **2024**: 33.10

The current P/E ratio of 35.53 is slightly above the five-year average of approximately 32.41, indicating a valuation that is higher than the historical norm but not excessively so.

## 4. Competitor Comparison

Below is a comparison of Microsoft and its main competitors based on key financial metrics:

| Company   | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| MSFT      | 35.53     | 12.66     | 35.79%        | 3,417.11       |
| AAPL      | 33.72     | 7.50      | 25.31%        | 3,280.73       |
| GOOGL     | 16.91     | 5.50      | 21.20%        | 1,876.56       |
| AMZN      | 58.20     | 3.20      | 4.10%         | 2,033.80       |
| ORCL      | 21.50     | 5.80      | 24.50%        | 163.10         |

*Note: Market capitalization values are in billions of USD.*

Compared to its peers, Microsoft's P/E ratio is higher than Alphabet's and Oracle's but lower than Amazon's. Its Profit Margin of 35.79% is the highest among the group, indicating strong profitability. The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is also higher than most competitors, reflecting a premium valuation.

## 5. Final Recommendation

**Recommendation**: **Hold**

**Conviction Level**: 7/10

**Justification**:

Microsoft's strong profitability, significant investments in AI, and strategic expansions position it well for long-term growth. However, the current P/E ratio of 35.53 is slightly above its historical average, suggesting that much of this optimism is already priced in. The recent workforce reduction indicates a focus on cost management, which could enhance future profitability. The resolution of the FTC case removes a potential overhang, allowing the company to fully integrate Activision Blizzard and capitalize on synergies.

**Risks and Catalysts**:

- **Risks**: Geopolitical tensions, particularly in Russia, could impact operations. Additionally, the high valuation leaves limited room for error; any earnings miss could lead to a significant stock price correction.

- **Catalysts**: Successful monetization of AI investments and continued growth in cloud services could drive future earnings. The integration of Activision Blizzard offers opportunities in the gaming sector.

**Investment Outlook**:

While Microsoft's fundamentals remain strong, the current valuation suggests that the stock is fairly priced. Investors should monitor the company's execution on AI initiatives and cloud growth. Given the slightly elevated P/E ratio, it may be prudent to wait for a more attractive entry point before increasing exposure.
