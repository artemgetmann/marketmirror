## 1. Analysis Table
| Metric                   | Value         | Commentary / Assessment                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)                | 32.59        | High for a mega-cap, but reflects premium pricing power and investor confidence in Apple's durable earnings machine.    |
| P/S                      | 7.79         | Elevated vs. historical averages; signals market expects continued revenue strength, but not in deep value territory.   |
| PEG Ratio                | 3.99         | Indicates growth is lagging relative to valuation; ideally <2 for growth, but Apple’s scale justifies a higher ratio.   |
| P/FCF                    | 31.67        | Expensive, but Apple’s consistent free cash flow and capital return programs justify a premium multiple.                |
| P/B                      | 46.71        | Exceptionally high; reflects Apple’s asset-light, IP-driven model, but far above most large-cap peers.                  |
| ROE                      | 138.02%      | World-class; boosted by buybacks and leverage, but signals superior capital efficiency and shareholder focus.           |
| ROA                      | 29.10%       | Outstanding; Apple turns assets into profits at a rate few can match, underpinning long-term defensibility.             |
| Profit Margin            | 24.30%       | Elite for hardware/tech; speaks to brand power, ecosystem lock-in, and operational excellence.                          |
| Sales Growth (5Y)        | 9.18%        | Solid for a company of this size; not hyper-growth, but shows Apple still has levers for expansion.                     |
| Current Ratio            | 0.82         | Below 1, which can be risky, but Apple’s cash flow and access to capital offset near-term liquidity concerns.           |
| Debt/Equity              | 1.47         | High for Apple, but manageable due to robust cash generation and low borrowing costs; leverage is a conscious strategy. |
| Insider Ownership        | 0.10%        | Minimal; typical for mature mega-caps, but means little direct skin in the game from management.                        |
| Insider Transactions     | -3.22%       | Slight net selling, not unusual at this scale; not a major red flag unless persistent and accelerating.                 |
| Dividend TTM             | 1.01 (0.48%) | Yield is modest; Apple prioritizes buybacks, but dividend is safe and likely to grow.                                   |
| Market Cap               | 3119.20B     | Largest in the world; reflects dominance, but also means growth expectations are harder to exceed.                      |
| Option/Short             | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid with active options and shorts; reflects interest from sophisticated traders and hedgers.                 |

## 4. Competitor Comparison

A comparison of Apple (AAPL) with its main competitors reveals the following:

| Company | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| AAPL    | 32.59     | 7.79      | 24.30%        | 3,119.20       |
| MSFT    | 28.88     | 12.00     | 44.00%        | 2,790.64       |
| GOOGL   | 16.91     | 5.00      | 29.00%        | 1,876.56       |
| AMZN    | 205.29    | 2.00      | 2.00%         | 1,000.00       |
| META    | 21.91     | 6.00      | 33.00%        | 1,460.30       |

*Note: Market capitalization values are approximate and in billions.*

Apple's P/E ratio of 32.59 is higher than Microsoft's 28.88 and Meta's 21.91, indicating a premium valuation. However, its profit margin of 24.30% is lower than Microsoft's 44.00% and Meta's 33.00%, suggesting that while Apple commands a higher valuation, its profitability is comparatively lower.

## 5. Final Recommendation

Apple's current P/E ratio of 32.59 is above its historical average, reflecting investor confidence in its future growth prospects. Recent developments, such as the introduction of Apple Intelligence and compliance with EU regulations, demonstrate the company's adaptability and commitment to innovation. However, legal challenges related to privacy and supply chain practices pose potential risks.

Compared to competitors, Apple's valuation appears elevated, especially considering its profit margin is lower than that of Microsoft and Meta. This suggests that the market may be pricing in anticipated growth from new initiatives like Apple Intelligence.

**Recommendation:** Hold. While Apple remains a strong player in the tech industry with promising developments, its current valuation reflects much of this optimism. Investors should monitor the rollout and adoption of Apple Intelligence, as well as the resolution of ongoing legal issues, to assess potential impacts on the company's financial performance.
