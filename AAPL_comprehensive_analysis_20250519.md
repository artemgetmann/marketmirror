Apple's P/E ratio of 33.72 is higher than Microsoft's 28.88 and significantly higher than Alphabet's 16.91, suggesting that Apple is trading at a premium compared to these peers.

## 5. Final Recommendation

Apple Inc. demonstrates strong profitability with a profit margin of 24.30% and a substantial market capitalization of $3.28 trillion. However, recent regulatory challenges, including the DOJ's antitrust lawsuit, and significant layoffs in discontinued projects, may pose risks. The current P/E ratio of 33.72 is above the S&P 500's historical average, indicating a premium valuation. Compared to competitors like Microsoft and Alphabet, Apple's valuation appears elevated.

**Recommendation:** Given the premium valuation and potential regulatory headwinds, a cautious approach is advisable. Investors should monitor ongoing legal developments and assess their impact on Apple's financial performance. Considering these factors, a **Hold** position is recommended, with a focus on staying informed about regulatory outcomes and market responses.
