YOU MUST NOT REGENERATE THE ANALYSIS TABLE.\n\nNow, perform additional research and create ONLY the following sections:\n\n## 2. Recent News\n- Summarize key recent developments affecting the company.\n- Focus on:\n  - Regulatory issues\n  - Layoffs or hiring\n  - Management changes\n  - Political or macroeconomic headwinds\n  - Any impactful product launches or earnings surprises\n\nSources to use: Google News, MarketBeat, Crunchbase headlines, Yahoo Finance\n\n## 3. Historical Valuation\n- Retrieve the company's historical P/E ratios (ideally year-end values from 2019 to now).\n- Comment on how the current P/E compares to its historical average and highs/lows, using the Finviz P/E of 32.51 as the current value.\n- Use Macrotrends or Gurufocus for accurate historical data only.\n\n## 4. Competitor Comparison\n- Present a clean comparison table of AAPL and its main competitors with the following format:\n\n| Company | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|\n| AAPL | 32.51 | 7.77 | 24.30% | 3111.73B |\n| Competitor 1 | value | value | value | value |\n| Competitor 2 | value | value | value | value |\n\n- For AAPL, use ONLY the Finviz values already provided: P/E: 32.51, P/S: 7.77, Profit Margin: 24.30%, Market Cap: 3111.73B\n- Highlight if AAPL is overvalued or undervalued compared to peers.\n\n## 5. Final Recommendation\n- Based on ALL findings, provide a comprehensive recommendation:\n  - Consider insider activity, historical valuation, news, and competitor positioning.\n  - Is AAPL a buy, hold, or sell?\n  - How justified is the current valuation?\n  - What risks or catalysts should investors watch?\n\nInclude a clear, actionable investment outlook in the final paragraph.\n\nIMPORTANT: ONLY generate sections 2-5. Do NOT include section 1 (Analysis Table) in your response. This will be combined with an existing analysis table.\n"
