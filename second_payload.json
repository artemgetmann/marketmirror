Recent News\n- Summarize key recent developments affecting the company.\n- Focus on:\n  - Regulatory issues\n  - Layoffs or hiring\n  - Management changes\n  - Political or macroeconomic headwinds\n  - Any impactful product launches or earnings surprises\n\nSources to use: Google News, MarketBeat, Crunchbase headlines, Yahoo Finance (DO NOT USE Wikipedia)\n\n## 3. Historical Valuation\n- Retrieve the company's historical P/E ratios (ideally year-end values from 2019 to now).\n- Comment on how the current P/E compares to its historical average and highs/lows, using the Finviz P/E of 33.23 as the current value.\n- Use Macrotrends or Gurufocus for accurate historical data only.\n\n## 4. Competitor Comparison\n- Identify main competitors in the same sector.\n- For each competitor (not AAPL), provide:\n  - P/E Ratio\n  - P/S Ratio\n  - Profit Margin\n  - Market Cap\n- For AAPL, use ONLY the Finviz values already provided: P/E: 33.23, P/S: 7.94, Profit Margin: 24.30%, Market Cap: 3180.29B\n- Highlight if AAPL is overvalued or undervalued compared to peers.\n\nUse: Jika.io, https://www.jika.io/quote/AAPL/competitors, Gurufocus https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/AAPL/summary?search=AAPL, or Finviz directly when possible.\n\n## 5. Final Recommendation\n- Based on ALL findings (the metrics in the analysis table plus your new research), provide a comprehensive recommendation:\n  - Consider insider activity, historical valuation, news, and competitor positioning.\n  - Is AAPL a buy, hold, or sell?\n  - How justified is the current valuation?\n  - What risks or catalysts should investors watch?\n\nInclude a clear, actionable investment outlook in the final paragraph.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT recreate the Analysis Table. Focus ONLY on generating sections 2-5 as requested, using the Finviz data as authoritative.\n"
