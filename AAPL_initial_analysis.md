| Metric                   | Value         | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)                | 30.47        | Elevated vs. S&P 500 average; reflects premium market confidence in Apple’s earnings durability and brand power.        |
| P/S                      | 7.28         | High for hardware; signals strong pricing power and market dominance, but leaves less margin for error on growth.      |
| PEG Ratio                | 3.73         | Well above 1; market expects slower growth relative to valuation, suggesting future growth is already priced in.        |
| P/FCF                    | 29.61        | Expensive, but justified by Apple’s consistent cash generation and capital return prowess.                              |
| P/B                      | 43.67        | Exceptionally high; Apple’s value is in intangible assets and ecosystem, not book equity—typical of dominant tech.      |
| ROE                      | 138.02%      | Off-the-charts; driven by massive profits and buybacks, but also reflects high leverage.                                |
| ROA                      | 29.10%       | World-class efficiency; Apple extracts huge profit from every dollar of assets deployed.                                |
| Profit Margin            | 24.30%       | Elite for hardware; shows Apple’s moat and pricing discipline.                                                          |
| Sales Growth (5Y)        | 9.18%        | Solid for a company of this size; not hyper-growth, but highly sustainable and resilient.                               |
| Current Ratio            | 0.82         | Below 1; Apple runs lean, but massive cash flow and access to liquidity make this a non-issue for a mega-cap.           |
| Debt/Equity              | 1.47         | Leverage is high, but manageable due to cash flows and credit rating; Apple borrows cheaply to fund buybacks/dividends. |
| Insider Ownership        | 0.10%        | Minimal; typical for mature mega-caps, not a red flag.                                                                 |
| Insider Transactions     | -1.92%       | Slight net selling, common in large companies; not necessarily a bearish signal.                                        |
| Dividend TTM             | 1.01 (0.52%) | Token yield; Apple prioritizes buybacks, but dividend is safe and growing.                                              |
| Market Cap               | 2916.52B     | The world’s largest company; scale offers moat, but limits explosive upside.                                            |
| Option/Short             | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid with robust derivatives market; attracts both institutional bulls and bears.                              |
