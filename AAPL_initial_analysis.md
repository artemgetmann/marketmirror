| Metric                | Value         | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)             | 30.94        | High for a mega-cap; market expects steady growth and pricing power. Tech peers often trade 25–40x in bull cycles.      |
| P/S                   | 7.40         | Elevated, reflecting premium brand and sticky ecosystem. Above S&P 500 average, but justified by margins and loyalty.   |
| PEG Ratio             | 3.83         | Expensive relative to growth rate; market pricing in slower earnings growth. PEG > 2 typically signals overvaluation.   |
| P/FCF                 | 30.07        | High but not extreme for dominant tech; Apple’s free cash flow is robust and reliable, supporting capital returns.      |
| P/B                   | 44.34        | Exceptionally high due to intangible value (brand, ecosystem). Not meaningful for asset-light tech giants.              |
| ROE                   | 138.02%      | Phenomenal; driven by high margins and aggressive buybacks. Top-tier among global companies.                            |
| ROA                   | 29.10%       | Extremely strong; Apple extracts huge profits from its asset base, showing operational excellence.                      |
| Profit Margin         | 24.30%       | Elite for hardware/software blend. Indicates strong pricing power and cost control.                                     |
| Sales Growth (5Y)     | 9.18%        | Solid for a company of this scale. Slower than smaller tech, but impressive given Apple’s size and maturity.            |
| Current Ratio         | 0.82         | Below 1; Apple relies on cash flow, not balance sheet liquidity. Not a concern given cash generation and credit access. |
| Debt/Equity           | 1.47         | Moderate leverage. Manageable due to cash flows; Apple uses debt for buybacks, not survival.                            |
| Insider Ownership     | 0.10%        | Very low, typical for mega-caps. No founder risk, but less insider “skin in the game.”                                 |
| Insider Transactions  | -1.92%       | Slight net selling; not alarming for a company of this size—common for executive diversification.                       |
| Dividend TTM          | 1.01 (0.51%) | Token yield. Apple prioritizes buybacks over dividends; yield is not the investment case here.                          |
| Market Cap            | 2961.18B     | World’s most valuable company. Massive liquidity; institutional favorite.                                               |
| Option/Short          | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid options and short interest. Suitable for tactical positioning and hedging.                                |
