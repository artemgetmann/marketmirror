| Metric                  | Value         | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                         |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 32.28        | Elevated for a mega-cap; reflects premium for stability and brand, but above historic norms for hardware-oriented tech.     |
| P/S                     | 7.72         | High vs. hardware peers; signals market confidence in pricing power and ecosystem stickiness.                               |
| PEG Ratio               | 3.96         | Well above 1; growth is slowing relative to valuation. Market is paying up for perceived safety and cash flow durability.   |
| P/FCF                   | 31.37        | Expensive; investors are betting on continued robust free cash flow, which Apple has delivered for years.                   |
| P/B                     | 46.27        | Extremely high; reflects intangible value (brand, ecosystem), but far above most tech peers.                                |
| ROE                     | 138.02%      | Exceptional; capital-light business model, aggressive buybacks, and massive profitability drive this figure.                |
| ROA                     | 29.10%       | Top-tier; Apple squeezes industry-leading returns from its asset base.                                                      |
| Profit Margin           | 24.30%       | Very strong for hardware; shows pricing power and operational efficiency.                                                   |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 9.18%        | Solid for a company of this scale, though not hypergrowth; justifies a premium, but not extreme multiples.                  |
| Current Ratio           | 0.82         | Below 1.0; Apple manages working capital tightly, but no liquidity stress given cash generation and market access.          |
| Debt/Equity             | 1.47         | Moderate leverage; comfortably serviced by cash flow, but higher than some tech peers.                                      |
| Insider Ownership       | 0.10%        | Minimal; typical for a mature mega-cap, not a red flag.                                                                    |
| Insider Transactions    | -1.92%       | Slight net selling; not unusual for execs in a stable, mature company.                                                      |
| Dividend TTM            | 1.01 (0.49%) | Token yield; Apple prioritizes buybacks over dividends, consistent with capital allocation strategy.                        |
| Market Cap              | 3089.63B     | World's largest company; liquidity is unmatched, institutional favorite.                                                    |
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid options and short interest; reflects broad participation and hedging activity.                                |
