| Metric                | Value       | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)             | 30.47       | High for a mega-cap; reflects premium for stability and brand, but elevated vs. historical Apple and S&P 500 average. |
| P/S                   | 7.28        | Rich multiple; signals strong market confidence, but leaves little room for error in growth or margins.               |
| PEG Ratio             | 3.73        | Well above 1; market expects slower growth vs. valuation, showing possible overpricing unless growth re-accelerates.  |
| P/FCF                 | 29.61       | Expensive vs. tech peers; suggests market is paying up for Apple’s cash generation and resilience.                    |
| P/B                   | 43.67       | Extremely high; Apple’s value is in intangibles and ecosystem, not book assets—investors pay for dominance, not assets.|
| ROE                   | 138.02%     | Off-the-charts; driven by high leverage and massive buybacks, but still a sign of capital efficiency.                 |
| ROA                   | 29.10%      | Exceptional; Apple converts assets to profit better than almost any other large-cap.                                  |
| Profit Margin         | 24.30%      | Elite for hardware/consumer tech; reflects pricing power and operational excellence.                                  |
| Sales Growth (5Y)     | 9.18%       | Solid for a company of this size; not hypergrowth, but steady and reliable.                                           |
| Current Ratio         | 0.82        | Below 1; Apple runs lean, but liquidity risk is low given cash flow and access to capital markets.                    |
| Debt/Equity           | 1.47        | Aggressively leveraged for buybacks/dividends, not operational need; sustainable given cash flow.                     |
| Insider Ownership     | 0.10%       | Low; typical for mature mega-caps, not a red flag.                                                                   |
| Insider Transactions  | -1.92%      | Mild net selling; not unusual at this scale, but worth monitoring for trend shifts.                                   |
| Dividend TTM          | 1.01 (0.52%)| Token yield; Apple prioritizes buybacks for capital return, not income.                                               |
| Market Cap            | 2916.52B    | Largest in the world; liquidity is unmatched, but size limits hypergrowth upside.                                     |
| Option/Short          | Yes / Yes   | Highly liquid options/short market—favored by institutions, but no unique signal.                                     |
