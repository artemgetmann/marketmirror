| Metric                     | Value        | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                       |
|----------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)                  | 30.47        | Elevated for a mega-cap; signals market confidence in durability, but not "cheap" — justified only by relentless cash flow.|
| P/S                        | 7.28         | High versus historical tech norms; reflects pricing power and premium brand, but leaves less margin for error.            |
| PEG Ratio                  | 3.73         | Well above 1; growth is not keeping pace with valuation, so market is paying up for stability and ecosystem stickiness.   |
| P/FCF                      | 29.61        | Expensive on free cash flow, but Apple’s cash machine status and capital return program support a premium.                |
| P/B                        | 43.67        | Sky-high due to intangible value (brand, ecosystem); not meaningful for asset-light tech, but signals rich expectations.  |
| ROE                        | 138.02%      | Outrageous efficiency driven by buybacks and asset-light model; signals best-in-class capital deployment.                 |
| ROA                        | 29.10%       | Excellent — Apple wrings profit from every asset, far above industry average.                                             |
| Profit Margin              | 24.30%       | Elite for hardware + services; Apple’s moat allows for sustained premium margins.                                         |
| Sales Growth (5Y)          | 9.18%        | Steady, not hypergrowth; mature but still outpacing many peers given scale.                                               |
| Current Ratio              | 0.82         | Below 1, but not a red flag for Apple — fortress balance sheet, short-term liabilities easily managed by cash generation. |
| Debt/Equity                | 1.47         | High, but strategic; Apple uses leverage for buybacks/dividends, not operational risk.                                    |
| Insider Ownership          | 0.10%        | Typical for mega-cap; low alignment, but mitigated by institutional oversight and buyback discipline.                     |
| Insider Transactions       | -1.92%       | Minor insider selling; not uncommon at this scale, not a thesis-breaker.                                                  |
| Dividend TTM               | 1.01 (0.52%) | Token yield; Apple prioritizes buybacks, but dividend signals confidence in cash flows.                                   |
| Market Cap                 | 2916.52B     | Largest company globally; liquidity and scale create stability, but limit explosive upside.                               |
| Option/Short               | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid options and short interest; reflects deep institutional participation and hedging, not directional risk.    |
