| Metric                   | Value        | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)                | 31.34       | Elevated vs. historical averages; market pricing in premium for resilience and brand, but not at bubble levels for megacap tech.   |
| P/S                      | 7.49        | High; reflects strong pricing power and brand moat, but leaves less margin for error if growth slows.                              |
| PEG Ratio                | 3.88        | Well above 1; signals market expects slower earnings growth relative to valuation—caution on future upside unless growth re-accelerates. |
| P/FCF                    | 30.46       | Expensive relative to typical large-cap tech (ideal <20), but justified by Apple’s cash generation and capital return discipline.  |
| P/B                      | 44.92       | Exceptionally high; Apple’s asset-light, brand-driven model makes book value less relevant, but this is elevated even for tech.    |
| ROE                      | 138.02%     | Off-the-charts; driven by high margins, buybacks, and leverage. Shows Apple’s capital efficiency, but leverage boosts this number. |
| ROA                      | 29.10%      | Outstanding; Apple squeezes maximum returns from its asset base—rare for a company of this size.                                   |
| Profit Margin            | 24.30%      | Elite; shows Apple’s ability to command premium pricing and maintain operational discipline.                                       |
| Sales Growth (5Y)        | 9.18%       | Solid for a $3T company; not hypergrowth, but steady and reliable—reflects maturity and ecosystem stickiness.                      |
| Current Ratio            | 0.82        | Below 1; not ideal, but Apple’s cash flow and access to capital make liquidity concerns minimal.                                   |
| Debt/Equity              | 1.47        | High for a tech giant; Apple uses debt for buybacks and capital efficiency, not operational need—manageable given cash flows.      |
| Insider Ownership        | 0.10%       | Minimal; typical for mature megacaps. Alignment with shareholders comes from buybacks/dividends, not insider skin in the game.     |
| Insider Transactions     | -1.92%      | Slight net selling; not unusual at this scale, but worth monitoring for trend shifts.                                              |
| Dividend TTM             | 1.01 (0.50%)| Low yield; Apple prioritizes buybacks over dividends, but steady payout signals confidence.                                        |
| Market Cap               | 2999.86B    | Largest publicly traded company; scale offers defensibility, but limits future hypergrowth.                                        |
| Option/Short             | Yes / Yes   | Highly liquid options market; attracts both hedgers and speculators—volatility can be amplified during macro events.               |
