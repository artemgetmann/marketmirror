| Metric                  | Value         | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 30.47        | Premium multiple; reflects market confidence in Apple's durable earnings, but above historical tech average (15-25), pricing in growth.   |
| P/S                     | 7.28         | High for hardware; signals strong brand/pricing power, but could limit upside if revenue growth stalls.                                   |
| PEG Ratio               | 3.73         | Well above 1.0 (fair value); market expects slower growth, possibly over-penalizing mature tech.                                          |
| P/FCF                   | 29.61        | Indicates investors pay up for Apple’s robust free cash flow, a sign of quality, but not a value play.                                    |
| P/B                     | 43.67        | Exceptionally high; typical for asset-light, IP-driven giants, but leaves little margin for error.                                        |
| ROE                     | 138.02%      | Outrageously strong; driven by massive buybacks and profitability—Apple is a capital-return machine.                                      |
| ROA                     | 29.10%       | Elite efficiency; Apple wrings huge returns from its asset base, rare even among tech titans.                                             |
| Profit Margin           | 24.30%       | World-class for hardware; signals pricing power and operational excellence.                                                               |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 9.18%        | Solid for a $2.9T company; not hyper-growth, but consistent and resilient in a mature market.                                             |
| Current Ratio           | 0.82         | Below 1.0; Apple runs lean, but its cash generation and credit access make liquidity risk negligible.                                     |
| Debt/Equity             | 1.47         | Moderate leverage; Apple can easily service debt, uses it for buybacks and capital efficiency.                                            |
| Insider Ownership       | 0.10%        | Very low; typical for mega-caps, but no founder “skin in the game.”                                                                      |
| Insider Transactions    | -1.92%       | Minor net selling; not unusual at this scale, but worth watching for trend shifts.                                                       |
| Dividend TTM            | 1.01 (0.52%) | Token yield; Apple prefers buybacks, but dividend is ultra-safe and could rise.                                                          |
| Market Cap              | 2916.52B     | Unmatched scale; Apple is the world’s most valuable company, with liquidity and institutional support.                                    |
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid options market; short interest is always present, but rarely a major threat to price stability in Apple.                   |
