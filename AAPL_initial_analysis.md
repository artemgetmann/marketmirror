| Metric                     | Value         | Commentary / Assessment                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)                  | 31.37        | Elevated vs. S&P 500 average (~20); reflects premium for brand, ecosystem, and cash flow stability. Not cheap, but not outlandish for a tech leader with fortress margins.         |
| P/S                        | 7.50         | High for hardware, but justified by Apple’s pricing power and sticky customer base. Market expects continued monetization and ecosystem lock-in.                                    |
| PEG Ratio                  | 3.88         | Well above 1; signals slower expected growth relative to price. Market is paying up for safety and brand, but this is a drag for pure growth investors.                            |
| P/FCF                      | 30.49        | Expensive but supported by Apple’s consistent, massive free cash flow. Market is confident in cash generation even during cyclical slowdowns.                                      |
| P/B                        | 44.96        | Exceptionally high; Apple’s value is intangible (brand, IP, ecosystem), so book value is less relevant here. Not a concern unless asset impairment risk rises.                     |
| ROE                        | 138.02%      | Astronomical; driven by buybacks and asset-light model. Indicates extreme capital efficiency, but also boosted by high leverage.                                                  |
| ROA                        | 29.10%       | Outstanding; Apple extracts huge profits from its asset base. Reflects operational excellence and scale advantages.                                                               |
| Profit Margin              | 24.30%       | Elite for consumer hardware/services. Shows pricing power, supply chain mastery, and recurring revenue from services.                                                             |
| Sales Growth (5Y)          | 9.18%        | Solid for a $3T company, but below hypergrowth peers. Reflects maturity; future upside depends on new product cycles and services expansion.                                      |
| Current Ratio              | 0.82         | Below 1.0; technically a risk, but mitigated by Apple’s cash hoard and access to capital. Not a red flag for a company with Apple’s creditworthiness.                             |
| Debt/Equity                | 1.47         | High for a tech giant, but manageable given cash flows and low rates. Apple uses leverage for buybacks and tax efficiency, not survival.                                          |
| Insider Ownership          | 0.10%        | Minimal; typical for mega-caps. Founders have exited. No alignment concern, but little “skin in the game” from insiders.                                                          |
| Insider Transactions       | -1.92%       | Slight net selling; not unusual at this scale. Not a major bearish signal unless trend accelerates.                                                                               |
| Dividend TTM               | 1.01 (0.50%) | Token yield; Apple prioritizes buybacks over dividends. Not a yield play, but shows confidence in cash flows.                                                                     |
| Market Cap                 | 3002.70B     | Absolute behemoth. Scale limits outsized growth but ensures resilience and pricing power.                                                                                        |
| Option/Short               | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid options and short interest; reflects institutional focus and hedging activity. No liquidity or trading constraints.                                                 |
