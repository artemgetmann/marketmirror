AAPL is a cash-printing machine with a cult brand, but the market is paying a luxury premium for yesterday’s innovation.

| Metric                | Value        | Commentary                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **P/E (TTM)**         | 31.28       | Overpriced for current growth—market is paying up for safety, not upside.  |
| **P/S**               | 7.48        | High—investors are treating Apple like a SaaS, not a hardware giant.       |
| **PEG Ratio**         | 3.87        | Ugly—growth doesn’t justify the multiple, future returns get squeezed.     |
| **P/FCF**             | 30.39       | Expensive—free cash flow is strong, but you’re paying a nosebleed premium. |
| **P/B**               | 44.83        | Absurd—market treats Apple as untouchable, ignores tangible book value.    |
| **ROE**               | 138.02%     | Outrageous—financial engineering and buybacks juicing returns.             |
| **ROA**               | 29.10%      | Excellent—asset-light, hyper-efficient money machine.                      |
| **Profit Margin**     | 24.30%      | Elite—Apple prints profits like few others in history.                     |
| **Sales Growth (5Y)** | 9.18%       | Solid but not explosive—mature giant, not a rocket ship.                   |
| **Current Ratio**     | 0.82        | Weak—Apple runs lean, but this is flirting with risk if the tide turns.    |
| **Debt/Equity**       | 1.47        | Heavy—Apple borrows big for buybacks, not for growth.                      |
| **Insider Ownership** | 0.10%       | Pathetic—leadership has little skin in the game.                           |
| **Insider Transactions** | -1.92%   | Negative—insiders are cashing out, not doubling down.                      |
| **Dividend TTM**      | 1.01 (0.50%)| Token dividend—income investors, look elsewhere.                           |
| **Market Cap**        | 2993.44B    | Colossus—Apple is the market, not a disruptor anymore.                     |
| **Option/Short**      | Yes / Yes   | Liquid and tradable—hedge funds play here, but the crowd is massive.       |
