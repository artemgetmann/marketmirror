| Metric                  | Value        | Commentary / Assessment                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 31.23       | Elevated for a mega-cap; implies market confidence in sustained growth, but above historical tech averages (15-25).      |
| P/S                     | 7.47        | High for hardware, but justified by Apple’s brand power and services mix; signals premium pricing and margin strength.   |
| PEG Ratio               | 3.87        | Well above 1.0; suggests price outpaces expected growth, but market may be over-discounting near-term growth slowdown.   |
| P/FCF                   | 30.35       | Expensive on free cash flow, but Apple’s cash generation is industry-leading; market pays up for fortress-like FCF.      |
| P/B                     | 44.76       | Sky-high due to low book value (asset-light, buybacks); not a useful metric for Apple’s business model.                  |
| ROE                     | 138.02%     | Staggering return; driven by buybacks and asset-light model. Indicates capital efficiency, but also high leverage.       |
| ROA                     | 29.10%      | Exceptionally strong; shows Apple’s ability to generate profit from assets, far above tech peers.                        |
| Profit Margin           | 24.30%      | Elite for hardware/software hybrid; reflects pricing power and operational efficiency.                                   |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 9.18%       | Solid for a company of this scale; not hypergrowth, but highly resilient for a $3T behemoth.                             |
| Current Ratio           | 0.82        | Below 1, which would be a red flag elsewhere; Apple’s cash flow and access to capital offset short-term liquidity risk.  |
| Debt/Equity             | 1.47        | Higher than peers; leveraged balance sheet, but manageable due to cash flow and strong credit rating.                    |
| Insider Ownership       | 0.10%       | Minimal; typical for mature mega-caps, not a concern here.                                                               |
| Insider Transactions    | -1.92%      | Slight net selling; not unusual, but worth monitoring for trend changes.                                                 |
| Dividend TTM            | 1.01 (0.50%)| Token yield; Apple prioritizes buybacks, but dividend is safe and growing.                                               |
| Market Cap              | 2989.41B    | Largest public company; scale provides resilience but limits future growth acceleration.                                 |
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes   | Highly liquid; options and short interest enable active trading, but short thesis is weak given fundamentals.            |
