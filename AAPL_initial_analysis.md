| Metric                | Value        | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)             | 30.83       | High for a mega-cap; reflects premium for brand, ecosystem, and resilience. Market expects continued strong earnings. |
| P/S                   | 7.37        | Elevated; signals market confidence in pricing power and future growth. Tech peers often in 5–10 range.               |
| PEG Ratio             | 3.82        | Well above 1; indicates growth is priced at a steep premium. Not a "growth at a reasonable price" play right now.     |
| P/FCF                 | 29.96       | Expensive; investors pay up for Apple’s reliable cash generation. Typical for dominant tech franchises.               |
| P/B                   | 44.19       | Exceptionally high; Apple’s value is in intangible assets, not book value. Typical for mature, high-margin tech.      |
| ROE                   | 138.02%     | Outstanding. Massive returns on equity, supercharged by buybacks and high-margin business.                            |
| ROA                   | 29.10%      | Elite asset efficiency. Apple extracts huge profits from its asset base.                                              |
| Profit Margin         | 24.30%      | World-class. Apple’s brand and ecosystem drive superior profitability.                                                |
| Sales Growth (5Y)     | 9.18%       | Solid for a $3T company; not hypergrowth, but highly sustainable.                                                     |
| Current Ratio         | 0.82        | Below 1.0; normal for Apple, which manages working capital tightly. Not a concern given cash generation.              |
| Debt/Equity           | 1.47        | Moderate leverage, but easily serviceable with Apple’s cash flow. Not risky in this context.                          |
| Insider Ownership     | 0.10%       | Minimal; typical for mature mega-caps. No founder-level skin in the game.                                             |
| Insider Transactions  | -1.92%      | Slight net selling; not unusual at this scale. No red flag unless trend accelerates.                                  |
| Dividend TTM          | 1.01 (0.51%)| Token yield; Apple prioritizes buybacks and growth over income.                                                       |
| Market Cap            | 2950.72B    | Largest public company; liquidity and scale unmatched.                                                                |
| Option/Short          | Yes / Yes   | Highly liquid options and active short interest; typical for mega-cap tech.                                           |
