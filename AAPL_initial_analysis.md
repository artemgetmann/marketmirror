| Metric                | Value        | Commentary / Assessment                                                                                       |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)             | 31.48       | Elevated vs. S&P 500 average (~20); reflects premium for quality, but not cheap. Investors expect growth.    |
| P/S                   | 7.52        | High for hardware; signals strong brand and pricing power, but leaves less margin for error.                 |
| PEG Ratio             | 3.86        | Well above 1; suggests growth is priced in, or future growth expectations are modest relative to valuation.  |
| P/FCF                 | 30.59       | High, but justified by Apple’s robust and recurring cash generation. Not a value play, but a quality one.   |
| P/B                   | 45.11       | Extremely high due to low tangible assets; typical for brand-heavy, asset-light tech giants.                |
| ROE                   | 138.02%     | Off-the-charts; driven by high margins and aggressive buybacks. Indicates world-class capital efficiency.   |
| ROA                   | 29.10%      | Exceptional asset efficiency; Apple is squeezing maximum profit from its resources.                         |
| Profit Margin         | 24.30%      | Elite for hardware; shows pricing power and operational excellence.                                         |
| Sales Growth (5Y)     | 9.18%       | Solid for a mega-cap; not hypergrowth, but highly sustainable for a mature company.                         |
| Current Ratio         | 0.82        | Below 1; signals reliance on cash flow, not balance sheet cash. Not ideal, but Apple’s cash machine status offsets risk. |
| Debt/Equity           | 1.47        | Moderately leveraged; aggressive but manageable due to consistent cash flow and low default risk.            |
| Insider Ownership     | 0.10%       | Low, but typical for mega-caps; no founder risk, but less direct alignment.                                 |
| Insider Transactions  | -1.92%      | Slight net selling; not unusual at this scale, not a red flag unless trend accelerates.                     |
| Dividend TTM          | 1.01 (0.50%)| Token yield; Apple prefers buybacks. Not for income investors, but signals financial strength.              |
| Market Cap            | 3012.41B    | Largest public company; liquidity is unmatched, but growth law of large numbers applies.                    |
| Option/Short          | Yes / Yes   | Deeply liquid options and short interest; efficient market, but also enables large asymmetric bets.         |
