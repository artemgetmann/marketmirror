| Metric                   | Value         | Commentary / Assessment                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)                | 32.59        | High for a mega-cap, but reflects premium pricing power and investor confidence in Apple's durable earnings machine.    |
| P/S                      | 7.79         | Elevated vs. historical averages; signals market expects continued revenue strength, but not in deep value territory.   |
| PEG Ratio                | 3.99         | Indicates growth is lagging relative to valuation; ideally <2 for growth, but Apple’s scale justifies a higher ratio.   |
| P/FCF                    | 31.67        | Expensive, but Apple’s consistent free cash flow and capital return programs justify a premium multiple.                |
| P/B                      | 46.71        | Exceptionally high; reflects Apple’s asset-light, IP-driven model, but far above most large-cap peers.                  |
| ROE                      | 138.02%      | World-class; boosted by buybacks and leverage, but signals superior capital efficiency and shareholder focus.           |
| ROA                      | 29.10%       | Outstanding; Apple turns assets into profits at a rate few can match, underpinning long-term defensibility.             |
| Profit Margin            | 24.30%       | Elite for hardware/tech; speaks to brand power, ecosystem lock-in, and operational excellence.                          |
| Sales Growth (5Y)        | 9.18%        | Solid for a company of this size; not hyper-growth, but shows Apple still has levers for expansion.                     |
| Current Ratio            | 0.82         | Below 1, which can be risky, but Apple’s cash flow and access to capital offset near-term liquidity concerns.           |
| Debt/Equity              | 1.47         | High for Apple, but manageable due to robust cash generation and low borrowing costs; leverage is a conscious strategy. |
| Insider Ownership        | 0.10%        | Minimal; typical for mature mega-caps, but means little direct skin in the game from management.                        |
| Insider Transactions     | -3.22%       | Slight net selling, not unusual at this scale; not a major red flag unless persistent and accelerating.                 |
| Dividend TTM             | 1.01 (0.48%) | Yield is modest; Apple prioritizes buybacks, but dividend is safe and likely to grow.                                   |
| Market Cap               | 3119.20B     | Largest in the world; reflects dominance, but also means growth expectations are harder to exceed.                      |
| Option/Short             | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid with active options and shorts; reflects interest from sophisticated traders and hedgers.                 |
