| Metric                  | Value        | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                         |
|-------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 32.38       | Elevated for a mega-cap; reflects premium for brand, ecosystem, and recurring revenues. Higher than historical averages.    |
| P/S                     | 7.74        | Rich multiple; market is pricing in continued dominance and future growth, but not at bubble levels for top-tier tech.      |
| PEG Ratio               | 3.97        | Well above 1; implies valuation is high relative to expected growth. Market expects slower EPS growth ahead.                |
| P/FCF                   | 31.47       | Expensive versus most S&P 500 peers, but justified by Apple's consistent cash machine status and massive buybacks.          |
| P/B                     | 46.41       | Sky-high due to intangibles and capital-light model; not meaningful for tech giants, but shows market confidence.           |
| ROE                     | 138.02%     | Off-the-charts efficiency, juiced by buybacks and asset-light operations; best-in-class profitability.                      |
| ROA                     | 29.10%      | Exceptionally high; highlights Apple’s ability to generate returns from its asset base.                                     |
| Profit Margin           | 24.30%      | Elite for hardware/software blend; shows pricing power and operational excellence.                                          |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | N/A         | Not provided, but Apple’s historical growth has slowed; mature phase, but still expanding via services and wearables.       |
| Current Ratio           | 0.82        | Below 1; Apple runs lean, but cash pile and cash flow mitigate liquidity concerns. Not a red flag for a company this size.  |
| Debt/Equity             | 1.47        | Leveraged, but manageable due to steady cash flow and low borrowing costs. Used for buybacks, not survival.                 |
| Insider Ownership       | N/A         | Data not available; typically low for mega-caps. Not a key driver for Apple at this scale.                                  |
| Insider Transactions    | N/A         | Data not available; not a major concern unless significant selling occurs, which is not flagged here.                       |
| Dividend TTM            | 1.01 (0.49%)| Token yield; Apple prefers buybacks. Dividend is safe and likely to grow, but not a primary draw for investors.             |
| Market Cap              | 3099.19B    | Largest public company on earth; liquidity and scale are unmatched.                                                         |
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes   | Highly liquid options market; short interest is always present but rarely threatening for Apple’s size and stability.        |
