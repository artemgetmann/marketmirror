| Metric                  | Value         | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 31.29        | Elevated vs. S&P 500 average (~20); reflects premium for brand, ecosystem, and cash flow stability.                   |
| P/S                     | 7.48         | High for hardware; signals market confidence in Apple’s pricing power and recurring revenue streams.                  |
| PEG Ratio               | 3.90         | Above ideal (<2); implies growth is not keeping up with valuation—market expects future innovation or margin defense. |
| P/FCF                   | 30.41        | Expensive on free cash flow; suggests investors are paying up for reliability and capital return consistency.         |
| P/B                     | 44.84        | Exceptionally high; Apple’s intangible assets and buybacks distort book value—normal for dominant tech franchises.    |
| ROE                     | 138.02%      | Off-the-charts; driven by massive buybacks and asset-light model, but not directly comparable to most companies.      |
| ROA                     | 29.10%       | World-class efficiency; Apple turns assets into profit far better than most peers.                                   |
| Profit Margin           | 24.30%       | Elite for hardware; sustained by ecosystem lock-in and high-margin services.                                         |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 8.51%        | Solid for a $3T company; growth is slowing but still outpaces most mature peers.                                     |
| Current Ratio           | 0.82         | Below 1; low, but Apple’s cash flow and access to capital offset short-term liquidity risks.                         |
| Debt/Equity             | 1.47         | Moderate leverage; manageable given cash generation and low rates, but bears watch for future interest cost impact.   |
| Insider Ownership       | 0.10%        | Minimal; typical for mega-caps, but signals little “skin in the game” from leadership.                               |
| Insider Transactions    | -1.92%       | Slight net selling; not unusual for Apple, but worth monitoring for trend shifts.                                    |
| Dividend TTM            | 1.01 (0.50%) | Token yield; Apple prioritizes buybacks, but dividend is reliable and growing.                                       |
| Market Cap              | 2994.48B     | Largest in the world; scale provides defensibility but limits hyper-growth potential.                                |
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid with active derivatives market; signals institutional interest and hedging activity.                   |
