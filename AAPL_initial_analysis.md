Apple is a cash-printing luxury tech empire with a price tag that pretends growth is infinite.

| Metric               | Value      | Commentary                                                                                   |
|----------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **P/E (TTM)**        | 31.53      | Overpriced for a company this mature—market is paying for nostalgia, not future growth.      |
| **P/S**              | 7.54       | Sky-high—investors are ignoring slowing revenue expansion.                                   |
| **PEG Ratio**        | 3.90       | Growth is nowhere near justifying this premium—PEG this high is a red flag.                 |
| **P/FCF**            | 30.64      | Paying luxury prices for cash flow—no margin of safety here.                                |
| **P/B**              | 45.18      | Absurd—Apple’s moat is brand, not tangible assets, but this is way past rational.           |
| **ROE**              | 138.02%    | Off-the-charts—debt-fueled, but Apple turns capital into profit better than anyone.         |
| **ROA**              | 29.10%     | Elite—Apple squeezes real returns from every dollar of assets.                              |
| **Profit Margin**    | 24.30%     | Fortress margins—pricing power and operational discipline, period.                          |
| **Sales Growth (5Y)**| 9.18%      | Respectable, but slowing—this isn’t a hypergrowth story anymore.                            |
| **Current Ratio**    | 0.82       | Weak—Apple leans on its cash machine, but liquidity risk is real if the engine sputters.    |
| **Debt/Equity**      | 1.47       | High—Apple is leveraged up, but the returns justify it (for now).                           |
| **Insider Ownership**| 0.10%      | Pathetic—founders and execs aren’t betting their own skin.                                  |
| **Insider Transactions** | -1.92% | Insiders are selling—never a bullish signal.                                                |
| **Dividend TTM**     | 1.01 (0.50%)| Token payout—Apple hoards cash for buybacks, not shareholders.                              |
| **Market Cap**       | 3017.19B   | Colossal—too big to move the needle with new products.                                      |
| **Option/Short**     | Yes / Yes  | Heavily traded—hedge funds play both sides, volatility is baked in.                         |

MarketMirror doesn't wear suits. Double-check the numbers. Even AI makes mistakes. Think for yourself — that's kind of the whole point.
