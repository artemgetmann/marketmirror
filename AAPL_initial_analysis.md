| Metric                  | Value         | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 32.28        | Elevated for a mega-cap; signals premium for stability and brand, but not “cheap” by traditional tech standards.             |
| P/S                     | 7.72         | High for hardware; reflects market’s faith in Apple’s pricing power and recurring revenue, but leaves less margin for error. |
| PEG Ratio               | 3.96         | Well above 1; suggests growth is not keeping pace with valuation—market expects more than current growth rate justifies.     |
| P/FCF                   | 31.37        | Expensive vs. historic averages; market is paying up for Apple’s cash generation consistency.                                |
| P/B                     | 46.27        | Exceptionally high, typical for brands with intangible value and capital-light business models; not a red flag for Apple.    |
| ROE                     | 138.02%      | Off-the-charts; driven by capital efficiency and aggressive buybacks—world-class shareholder returns.                        |
| ROA                     | 29.10%       | Impressive asset efficiency; Apple squeezes more profit from its assets than nearly any large-cap peer.                      |
| Profit Margin           | 24.30%       | Elite for hardware/consumer tech; reflects scale, loyalty, and premium pricing.                                              |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 9.18%        | Solid for a company of this scale, though not hyper-growth; supports a premium, but not at any price.                        |
| Current Ratio           | 0.82         | Below 1; Apple’s cash conversion cycle and supplier terms make this less concerning, but leaves no buffer for shocks.        |
| Debt/Equity             | 1.47         | Leveraged for a cash-rich company; Apple can handle it, but rising rates could pressure margins longer term.                 |
| Insider Ownership       | 0.10%        | Minimal; typical for a mature mega-cap, but no “skin in the game” from leadership.                                           |
| Insider Transactions    | -1.92%       | Slight net selling; not unusual, but not a bullish insider signal.                                                           |
| Dividend TTM            | 1.01 (0.49%) | Token yield; signals capital return, but not a draw for income investors.                                                    |
| Market Cap              | 3089.63B     | Largest public company; scale is both a moat and a growth headwind.                                                          |
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes    | Liquid options and short interest; reflects active institutional trading and hedging.                                        |
