| Metric                   | Value         | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)                | 30.47        | Elevated vs. S&P 500 average; reflects premium market confidence in Apple’s earnings durability and brand power.        |
| P/S                      | 7.28         | High for hardware; signals strong pricing power and market dominance, but leaves less margin for error on growth.      |
| PEG Ratio                | 3.73         | Well above 1; market expects slower growth relative to valuation, suggesting future growth is already priced in.        |
| P/FCF                    | 29.61        | Expensive, but justified by Apple’s consistent cash generation and capital return prowess.                              |
| P/B                      | 43.67        | Exceptionally high; Apple’s value is in intangible assets and ecosystem, not book equity—typical of dominant tech.      |
| ROE                      | 138.02%      | Off-the-charts; driven by massive profits and buybacks, but also reflects high leverage.                                |
| ROA                      | 29.10%       | World-class efficiency; Apple extracts huge profit from every dollar of assets deployed.                                |
| Profit Margin            | 24.30%       | Elite for hardware; shows Apple’s moat and pricing discipline.                                                          |
| Sales Growth (5Y)        | 9.18%        | Solid for a company of this size; not hyper-growth, but highly sustainable and resilient.                               |
| Current Ratio            | 0.82         | Below 1; Apple runs lean, but massive cash flow and access to liquidity make this a non-issue for a mega-cap.           |
| Debt/Equity              | 1.47         | Leverage is high, but manageable due to cash flows and credit rating; Apple borrows cheaply to fund buybacks/dividends. |
| Insider Ownership        | 0.10%        | Minimal; typical for mature mega-caps, not a red flag.                                                                 |
| Insider Transactions     | -1.92%       | Slight net selling, common in large companies; not necessarily a bearish signal.                                        |
| Dividend TTM             | 1.01 (0.52%) | Token yield; Apple prioritizes buybacks, but dividend is safe and growing.                                              |
| Market Cap               | 2916.52B     | The world’s largest company; scale offers moat, but limits explosive upside.                                            |
| Option/Short             | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid with robust derivatives market; attracts both institutional bulls and bears.                              |

## 2. Recent News

**Regulatory Issues and Tariffs**

President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple products if the company does not relocate iPhone manufacturing to the United States. This announcement led to a decline of over 2% in Apple's stock price at the opening of Wall Street. Trump criticized Apple's plans to shift production from China to India, emphasizing his preference for domestic manufacturing. The proposed tariffs are expected to take effect by the end of June. ([elpais.com](https://elpais.com/economia/2025-05-23/trump-amenaza-a-apple-con-aranceles-del-25-si-no-fabrica-el-iphone-en-estados-unidos.html?utm_source=openai))

In response, Apple is expanding its manufacturing operations in India. Foxconn, Apple's primary contractor, is investing $1.5 billion in a display module plant near Chennai and establishing a $450 million semiconductor assembly unit in Uttar Pradesh in partnership with HCL Technologies. This strategy aims to diversify Apple's supply chain away from China. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/7fdb8aaa-9296-4c57-a851-13db560a253f?utm_source=openai))

**Product Developments**

Apple plans to launch AI-enabled smart glasses by the end of 2026. These glasses are expected to feature a camera, microphone, speakers, and integration with Apple's Siri voice assistant. This move is part of Apple's efforts to enhance its artificial intelligence strategy and compete with Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses.

**Pricing Strategies**

Apple is considering raising prices for its upcoming fall iPhone lineup. The company aims to avoid attributing the potential price hikes to U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, despite most of its devices being assembled in China. The new iPhone models are projected to be priced up to $1,142, a 43% increase over the current $799 entry price. Analysts caution that this price increase could result in lost market share to competitors like Samsung.

## 3. Historical Valuation

Apple's current P/E ratio stands at 30.47. Historically, the company's P/E ratios at year-end were:

- **2019**: 22.46
- **2020**: 35.10
- **2021**: 28.89
- **2022**: 21.81
- **2023**: 29.81
- **2024**: 39.71

The current P/E ratio of 30.47 is above the 10-year average of 22.53 but below the recent high of 39.71 in 2024. This suggests that while Apple is trading at a premium compared to its long-term average, it is not at its peak valuation.

## 4. Competitor Comparison

Below is a comparison of Apple and its main competitors:

| Company | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| AAPL    | 30.47    | 7.28      | 24.30%        | 2,916.52       |
| MSFT    | 28.88    | N/A       | N/A           | 2,790.64       |
| GOOGL   | 16.91    | N/A       | N/A           | 1,876.56       |
| AMZN    | N/A      | N/A       | N/A           | N/A            |
| META    | 21.91    | N/A       | N/A           | 1,460.30       |

*Note: Some data for competitors are not available in the provided sources.*

Apple's P/E ratio is higher than that of Microsoft (28.88), Alphabet (16.91), and Meta (21.91), indicating a premium valuation compared to its peers. This suggests that the market has higher growth expectations for Apple relative to these competitors.

## 5. Final Recommendation

Apple's current valuation reflects its strong market position and growth prospects. The company's strategic expansion into AI-enabled products and diversification of its manufacturing base demonstrate proactive management. However, potential tariffs and price increases pose risks to demand and profitability.

Given the current P/E ratio of 30.47, which is above the historical average but below recent highs, and considering the competitive landscape, a **hold** recommendation is appropriate. Investors should monitor developments related to tariffs, manufacturing shifts, and product launches, as these factors could significantly impact Apple's financial performance and stock valuation.
