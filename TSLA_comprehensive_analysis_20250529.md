## 2. Recent News

**1. Leadership Commitment Under Scrutiny**

A coalition of 12 major pension funds, managing approximately $950 billion in assets, has demanded that Elon Musk dedicate at least 40 hours per week to Tesla or consider stepping down as CEO. Their concerns stem from Musk's multiple commitments and the perceived leadership crisis at Tesla. The group is also advocating for governance reforms, including a more active board and a clear CEO succession plan.

**2. Declining European Sales**

In April 2025, Tesla's vehicle sales in Europe plummeted by 49% year-over-year, dropping to 7,261 units from 14,228. This decline contrasts sharply with a 28% increase in overall battery-electric vehicle sales across the continent. Factors contributing to this downturn include growing backlash against Musk's political views, factory shutdowns for upgrades, and intensified competition from Chinese brands like SAIC.

**3. Robotaxi Service Launch**

Tesla is preparing to launch its long-anticipated robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 12, 2025. This initiative marks a strategic shift towards autonomous transportation, with plans to expand the service to cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. The success of this venture is critical for Tesla's future, especially amid recent global sales declines and public backlash related to Musk's political affiliations.

## 3. Historical Valuation

Tesla's current P/E ratio stands at 196.27. Historically, Tesla's P/E ratio has exhibited significant volatility:

- **2020:** Peaked at 940.89
- **2021:** Dropped to 188.37
- **2022:** Further declined to 30.64
- **2023:** Rose to 52.53
- **2024:** Increased to 181.09

The current P/E ratio of 196.27 is above the historical average of approximately 111.74. This elevated valuation suggests that Tesla is trading above its fair value based on historical metrics. Investors should be cautious, as such a high P/E ratio indicates that the market has priced in substantial future growth, leaving little room for error.

## 4. Competitor Comparison

Here's how Tesla stacks up against its most relevant competitors:

| Company | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| TSLA    | 196.27    | 11.99     | 6.65%         | 1147.97        |
| NIO     | N/A       | N/A       | N/A           | 6.44           |
| RIVN    | N/A       | N/A       | N/A           | 14.92          |
| F       | 5.5       | 0.3       | 2.4%          | 40.67          |
| GM      | 5.8       | 0.4       | 6.7%          | 55.12          |

Tesla's P/E ratio of 196.27 is significantly higher than traditional automakers like Ford (5.5) and General Motors (5.8), indicating a premium valuation. While Tesla leads in market cap and profit margin, its elevated P/E ratio suggests that it is overvalued compared to these peers.

## 5. Final Recommendation

**"TSLA is a HOLD because its current valuation is excessively high relative to both historical metrics and industry peers."**

**Conviction Level: 5/10**

While Tesla's innovation and market position are strong, the inflated P/E ratio and recent operational challenges warrant caution.

**Major Catalysts:**

1. **Robotaxi Service Launch:** Successful deployment could open new revenue streams and reinforce Tesla's leadership in autonomous driving.
2. **Leadership Stability:** Addressing governance concerns and ensuring Musk's full commitment could restore investor confidence.

**Major Risks:**

1. **Declining Sales:** Continued sales declines, especially in key markets like Europe, could impact financial performance.
2. **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Increased attention on autonomous driving technologies could lead to delays or additional costs.

**Price Target:**

Given the current overvaluation, a more reasonable entry point would be around $250, aligning with a P/E ratio closer to historical averages.
