| Metric                | Value        | Commentary                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **P/E (TTM)**         | 31.28       | Overpriced for current growth—market is paying up for safety, not upside.  |
| **P/S**               | 7.48        | High—investors are treating Apple like a SaaS, not a hardware giant.       |
| **PEG Ratio**         | 3.87        | Ugly—growth doesn’t justify the multiple, future returns get squeezed.     |
| **P/FCF**             | 30.39       | Expensive—free cash flow is strong, but you’re paying a nosebleed premium. |
| **P/B**               | 44.83        | Absurd—market treats Apple as untouchable, ignores tangible book value.    |
| **ROE**               | 138.02%     | Outrageous—financial engineering and buybacks juicing returns.             |
| **ROA**               | 29.10%      | Excellent—asset-light, hyper-efficient money machine.                      |
| **Profit Margin**     | 24.30%      | Elite—Apple prints profits like few others in history.                     |
| **Sales Growth (5Y)** | 9.18%       | Solid but not explosive—mature giant, not a rocket ship.                   |
| **Current Ratio**     | 0.82        | Weak—Apple runs lean, but this is flirting with risk if the tide turns.    |
| **Debt/Equity**       | 1.47        | Heavy—Apple borrows big for buybacks, not for growth.                      |
| **Insider Ownership** | 0.10%       | Pathetic—leadership has little skin in the game.                           |
| **Insider Transactions** | -1.92%   | Negative—insiders are cashing out, not doubling down.                      |
| **Dividend TTM**      | 1.01 (0.50%)| Token dividend—income investors, look elsewhere.                           |
| **Market Cap**        | 2993.44B    | Colossus—Apple is the market, not a disruptor anymore.                     |
| **Option/Short**      | Yes / Yes   | Liquid and tradable—hedge funds play here, but the crowd is massive.       |

## 2. Recent News

**Apple's Shift to Indian Manufacturing**

Apple plans to double its iPhone production in India and relocate all manufacturing for the U.S. market to the country by the end of 2026. This move aims to reduce dependence on China amid rising production costs due to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, which recently led to a $700 billion loss in Apple’s market value. Apple is strengthening ties with Indian manufacturers like Tata Electronics and is optimistic about potential tariff relief as U.S.-India trade talks progress.

**Lawsuit Over Delayed Apple Intelligence Launch**

Apple faces a federal lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in San Jose on March 19, 2025, over allegations of false advertising and unfair competition regarding the delayed launch of some Apple Intelligence features. The suit claims that Apple's marketing campaign misled consumers into purchasing new phones based on features that were not available at release.

## 3. Historical Valuation

Apple's current P/E ratio stands at 33.72. Historically, Apple's P/E ratio has fluctuated:

- **2024:** Peaked at 39.91 in December.
- **2023:** Ranged between 27.75 and 32.36.
- **2022:** Dropped to a low of 21.83 in December.
- **2019:** Averaged around 18.27.

Comparing the current P/E of 33.72 to the historical average, Apple is trading above its long-term average, indicating a premium valuation. Investors should assess whether Apple's growth prospects justify this elevated multiple. ([macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/aapl/apple/pe-ratio?utm_source=openai))

## 4. Competitor Comparison

Here's how Apple stacks up against its key competitors:

| Company   | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| AAPL      | 33.72     | 7.48      | 24.30%        | 3,280.73       |
| MSFT      | 28.88     | N/A       | N/A           | 2,790.64       |
| GOOGL     | 16.91     | N/A       | N/A           | 1,876.56       |

Apple's P/E ratio is higher than Microsoft's and significantly higher than Alphabet's, suggesting a premium valuation. Its profit margin is robust, but the elevated P/E ratio indicates that the stock may be overvalued compared to its peers.

## 5. Final Recommendation

**"AAPL is a HOLD because its premium valuation is not fully justified by its current growth prospects."**

**Conviction Level: 5/10**

Apple's strong profitability and strategic moves, like diversifying manufacturing to India, are positives. However, the elevated P/E ratio compared to historical averages and competitors suggests limited upside.

**Major Catalysts:**

1. **Supply Chain Diversification:** Shifting production to India could reduce costs and mitigate geopolitical risks.
2. **Product Innovation:** Successful launch of new products or services could drive revenue growth.

**Major Risks:**

1. **Legal Challenges:** Lawsuits over product delays could harm reputation and financials.
2. **Market Saturation:** Slowing growth in key markets could impact future earnings.

Given the current valuation and market conditions, maintaining a HOLD position on AAPL is prudent. Monitor upcoming earnings reports and strategic developments for potential re-evaluation.
