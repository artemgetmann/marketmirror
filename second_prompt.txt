Now, perform additional research and create the following sections:

## 2. Recent News
- Summarize key recent developments affecting the company.
- Focus on:
  - Regulatory issues
  - Layoffs or hiring
  - Management changes
  - Political or macroeconomic headwinds
  - Any impactful product launches or earnings surprises

Sources to use: Google News, MarketBeat, Crunchbase headlines, Yahoo Finance (DO NOT USE Wikipedia)

## 3. Historical Valuation
- Retrieve the company's historical P/E ratios (ideally year-end values from 2019 to now).
- Comment on how the current P/E compares to its historical average and highs/lows, using the Finviz P/E of 33.23 as the current value.
- Use Macrotrends or Gurufocus for accurate historical data only.

## 4. Competitor Comparison
- Identify main competitors in the same sector.
- For each competitor (not AAPL), provide:
  - P/E Ratio
  - P/S Ratio
  - Profit Margin
  - Market Cap
- For AAPL, use ONLY the Finviz values already provided: P/E: 33.23, P/S: 7.94, Profit Margin: 24.30%, Market Cap: 3180.29B
- Highlight if AAPL is overvalued or undervalued compared to peers.

Use: Jika.io, https://www.jika.io/quote/AAPL/competitors, Gurufocus https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/AAPL/summary?search=AAPL, or Finviz directly when possible.

## 5. Final Recommendation
- Based on ALL findings (the metrics in the analysis table plus your new research), provide a comprehensive recommendation:
  - Consider insider activity, historical valuation, news, and competitor positioning.
  - Is AAPL a buy, hold, or sell?
  - How justified is the current valuation?
  - What risks or catalysts should investors watch?

Include a clear, actionable investment outlook in the final paragraph.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT recreate the Analysis Table. Focus ONLY on generating sections 2-5 as requested, using the Finviz data as authoritative.
