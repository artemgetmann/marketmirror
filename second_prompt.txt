The Analysis Table section has already been created separately. YOU MUST NOT REGENERATE THE ANALYSIS TABLE.

Now, perform additional research and create ONLY the following sections:

## 2. Recent News
- Summarize key recent developments affecting the company.
- Focus on:
  - Regulatory issues
  - Layoffs or hiring
  - Management changes
  - Political or macroeconomic headwinds
  - Any impactful product launches or earnings surprises

Sources to use: Google News, MarketBeat, Crunchbase headlines, Yahoo Finance

## 3. Historical Valuation
- Retrieve the company's historical P/E ratios (ideally year-end values from 2019 to now).
- Comment on how the current P/E compares to its historical average and highs/lows, using the Finviz P/E of 189.56 as the current value.
- Use Macrotrends or Gurufocus for accurate historical data only.

## 4. Competitor Comparison
- Present a clean comparison table of TSLA and its main competitors with the following format:

| Company | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| TSLA | 189.56 | 11.58 | 6.65% | 1108.70B |
| Competitor 1 | value | value | value | value |
| Competitor 2 | value | value | value | value |

- For TSLA, use ONLY the Finviz values already provided: P/E: 189.56, P/S: 11.58, Profit Margin: 6.65%, Market Cap: 1108.70B
- Highlight if TSLA is overvalued or undervalued compared to peers.

## 5. Final Recommendation
- Based on ALL findings, provide a comprehensive recommendation:
  - Consider insider activity, historical valuation, news, and competitor positioning.
  - Is TSLA a buy, hold, or sell?
  - How justified is the current valuation?
  - What risks or catalysts should investors watch?

Include a clear, actionable investment outlook in the final paragraph.

IMPORTANT: ONLY generate sections 2-5. Do NOT include section 1 (Analysis Table) in your response. This will be combined with an existing analysis table.
