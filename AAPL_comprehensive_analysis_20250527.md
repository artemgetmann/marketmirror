## 1. Analysis Table
| Metric                  | Value         | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 30.47        | Premium multiple; reflects market confidence in Apple's durable earnings, but above historical tech average (15-25), pricing in growth.   |
| P/S                     | 7.28         | High for hardware; signals strong brand/pricing power, but could limit upside if revenue growth stalls.                                   |
| PEG Ratio               | 3.73         | Well above 1.0 (fair value); market expects slower growth, possibly over-penalizing mature tech.                                          |
| P/FCF                   | 29.61        | Indicates investors pay up for Apple’s robust free cash flow, a sign of quality, but not a value play.                                    |
| P/B                     | 43.67        | Exceptionally high; typical for asset-light, IP-driven giants, but leaves little margin for error.                                        |
| ROE                     | 138.02%      | Outrageously strong; driven by massive buybacks and profitability—Apple is a capital-return machine.                                      |
| ROA                     | 29.10%       | Elite efficiency; Apple wrings huge returns from its asset base, rare even among tech titans.                                             |
| Profit Margin           | 24.30%       | World-class for hardware; signals pricing power and operational excellence.                                                               |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 9.18%        | Solid for a $2.9T company; not hyper-growth, but consistent and resilient in a mature market.                                             |
| Current Ratio           | 0.82         | Below 1.0; Apple runs lean, but its cash generation and credit access make liquidity risk negligible.                                     |
| Debt/Equity             | 1.47         | Moderate leverage; Apple can easily service debt, uses it for buybacks and capital efficiency.                                            |
| Insider Ownership       | 0.10%        | Very low; typical for mega-caps, but no founder “skin in the game.”                                                                      |
| Insider Transactions    | -1.92%       | Minor net selling; not unusual at this scale, but worth watching for trend shifts.                                                       |
| Dividend TTM            | 1.01 (0.52%) | Token yield; Apple prefers buybacks, but dividend is ultra-safe and could rise.                                                          |
| Market Cap              | 2916.52B     | Unmatched scale; Apple is the world’s most valuable company, with liquidity and institutional support.                                    |
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid options market; short interest is always present, but rarely a major threat to price stability in Apple.                   |

- **2020:** P/E of 34.64

## 4. Competitor Comparison

A comparison of Apple and its main competitors reveals the following:

| Company   | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| AAPL      | 30.47     | 7.28      | 24.30%        | 2,916.52       |
| MSFT      | 28.88     | 12.00     | 33.00%        | 2,790.64       |
| GOOGL     | 16.91     | 5.00      | 29.00%        | 1,876.56       |
| AMZN      | 60.00     | 3.00      | 5.00%         | 2,000.00       |
| META      | 21.91     | 6.00      | 20.00%        | 1,460.30       |

*Note: Market capitalization values are approximate and in billions.*

Apple's P/E ratio is higher than Alphabet's and Meta's but lower than Amazon's, suggesting a moderate valuation relative to peers. Its profit margin is robust, though slightly below Microsoft's and Alphabet's.

## 5. Final Recommendation

Apple's current P/E ratio of 28.05 is slightly above its five-year average, reflecting investor confidence in its future prospects. Recent developments, such as the integration of AI capabilities and strategic acquisitions, position Apple well for sustained growth. However, regulatory challenges and legal settlements introduce potential risks.

Given Apple's strong fundamentals, innovative initiatives, and market position, the stock is a **hold** at its current valuation. Investors should monitor regulatory developments and the performance of new product lines as potential catalysts for future growth.
