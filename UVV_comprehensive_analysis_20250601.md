## 3. Historical Valuation

- **2019:** 14.0
- **2020:** 15.5
- **2021:** 16.7
- **2022:** 16.7
- **2023:** 10.6

([marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/UNIVERSAL-CORPORATION-14779/valuation/?utm_source=openai))

The current P/E ratio of 17.30 is above the five-year average of approximately 14.7, suggesting a higher valuation relative to recent history.

## 4. Competitor Comparison

Comparing UVV to its main competitors:

| Company | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| UVV     | 17.30     | 0.55      | 3.22%         | 1.62           |
| MO      | 8.92      | 3.00      | 28.00%        | 98.63          |
| PM      | 33.96     | 4.50      | 27.00%        | 239.20         |

([fullratio.com](https://fullratio.com/stocks/nyse-uvv/pe-ratio?utm_source=openai))

UVV's P/E ratio is higher than Altria Group's (MO) but lower than Philip Morris International's (PM). Its profit margin is significantly lower than both competitors, indicating potential operational inefficiencies or different business models.

## 5. Final Recommendation

**Recommendation:** Pass

**Conviction Level:** 8/10

**Rationale:**

Universal Corporation's current P/E ratio of 17.30 exceeds its five-year average, suggesting the stock may be overvalued. The company's profit margin of 3.22% is substantially lower than competitors like Altria (28%) and Philip Morris (27%), indicating potential operational challenges. While recent management changes and diversification efforts are noteworthy, they do not sufficiently offset concerns about valuation and profitability.

**Risks and Catalysts:**

- **Risks:** Continued low profit margins, potential regulatory challenges in the tobacco industry, and the success of diversification efforts.

- **Catalysts:** Effective execution of diversification strategies and improvements in operational efficiency leading to higher profit margins.

Given the current valuation and profitability metrics, UVV does not present an attractive asymmetric upside opportunity at this time. Investors should monitor the company's strategic initiatives and financial performance for potential future opportunities.
