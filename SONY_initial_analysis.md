| Metric                     | Value       | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)                  | 21.35       | Reasonable for a diversified tech/entertainment giant; not cheap, but not frothy—reflects steady earnings power.     |
| P/S                        | 1.87        | Low for a tech conglomerate; market isn’t pricing in high growth, suggesting skepticism or underappreciation.        |
| PEG Ratio                  | 6.89        | Very high; implies EPS growth is slow relative to price, or expectations are muted—market doubts near-term upside.   |
| P/FCF                      | 9.72        | Attractive; strong free cash flow yield, undervalued relative to cash generation compared to many tech peers.        |
| P/B                        | 2.91        | Fair for a company with strong IP and asset base; not excessive, but not a deep value play.                          |
| ROE                        | 14.32%      | Solid return on equity; demonstrates efficient capital use, above average for diversified electronics/entertainment. |
| ROA                        | 3.25%       | Modest; reflects capital-intensive business, but positive and stable.                                                |
| Profit Margin              | 8.83%       | Respectable for a conglomerate; higher than most consumer electronics, but lower than pure software plays.           |
| Sales Growth (5Y)          | 2.67%       | Anemic; market is right to question growth story—Sony is mature, but not shrinking.                                  |
| Current Ratio              | 0.70        | Weak; below 1.0 signals tight liquidity—watch for refinancing risk or short-term obligations.                        |
| Debt/Equity                | 0.51        | Conservative leverage; well managed, especially for a company of this scale.                                         |
| Insider Ownership          | 0.00%       | No insider skin in the game; common for Japanese conglomerates, but less aligned with US investor ideals.            |
| Insider Transactions       | N/A         | No actionable data; neutral.                                                                                         |
| Dividend TTM               | 0.07 (0.25%)| Token yield; Sony is not an income play, but a capital appreciation story.                                           |
| Market Cap                 | $158.94B    | Large-cap, liquid, institutionally held—fits the criteria for high-conviction, asymmetric bets.                      |
| Option/Short               | Yes / Yes   | Options and shorting available; liquid market, suitable for tactical positioning.                                    |
