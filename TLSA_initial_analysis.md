| Metric                    | Value        | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                       |
|---------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **P/E (TTM)**             | N/A          | No earnings reported; either unprofitable or in early growth stage. High-risk, demands conviction in future profitability.|
| **P/S**                   | N/A          | No reported sales; signals pre-revenue or very early-stage business. Not typical for large-cap asymmetric bets.           |
| **PEG Ratio**             | N/A          | No earnings or growth projections available; can't assess value vs. growth.                                               |
| **P/FCF**                 | N/A          | No free cash flow; company is not yet generating positive cash or is reinvesting heavily.                                 |
| **P/B**                   | 37.36        | Extremely high; market values assets at a huge premium. Only justified if future growth is explosive and defensible.      |
| **ROE**                   | 250.49%      | Off-the-charts return on equity, but likely distorted by tiny equity base or one-off events. Not sustainable.             |
| **ROA**                   | 101.10%      | Similarly sky-high; may reflect accounting quirks or recent asset-light business model. Scrutiny required.                |
| **Profit Margin**         | N/A          | No profit margin data; likely no profits. Red flag for a large-cap play unless massive upside is clear.                   |
| **Sales Growth (5Y)**     | 0.00%        | No sales growth in five years; highly concerning unless company just started reporting.                                   |
| **Current Ratio**         | 1.02         | Just above breakeven; barely covers short-term liabilities. Not robust, but not a liquidity crisis.                       |
| **Debt/Equity**           | 0.03         | Extremely low leverage; company avoids debt, which is positive in early stages or high-risk industries.                   |
| **Insider Ownership**     | 35.15%       | Very high; insiders have skin in the game, aligning interests with shareholders.                                          |
| **Insider Transactions**  | 0.00%        | No recent insider buying or selling; neutral, but worth monitoring for signals.                                           |
| **Dividend TTM**          | -            | No dividend; standard for early-stage or growth-focused companies.                                                        |
| **Market Cap**            | 147.03M      | Micro-cap territory; high volatility, not typical for large-cap asymmetric bets.                                          |
| **Option/Short**          | Yes / Yes    | Options and short interest available; liquidity for hedging/speculation, but also attracts volatility and scrutiny.        |
