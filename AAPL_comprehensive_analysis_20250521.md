|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 32.28        | Elevated for a mega-cap; reflects premium for stability and brand, but above historic norms for hardware-oriented tech.     |
| P/S                     | 7.72         | High vs. hardware peers; signals market confidence in pricing power and ecosystem stickiness.                               |
| PEG Ratio               | 3.96         | Well above 1; growth is slowing relative to valuation. Market is paying up for perceived safety and cash flow durability.   |
| P/FCF                   | 31.37        | Expensive; investors are betting on continued robust free cash flow, which Apple has delivered for years.                   |
| P/B                     | 46.27        | Extremely high; reflects intangible value (brand, ecosystem), but far above most tech peers.                                |
| ROE                     | 138.02%      | Exceptional; capital-light business model, aggressive buybacks, and massive profitability drive this figure.                |
| ROA                     | 29.10%       | Top-tier; Apple squeezes industry-leading returns from its asset base.                                                      |
| Profit Margin           | 24.30%       | Very strong for hardware; shows pricing power and operational efficiency.                                                   |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 9.18%        | Solid for a company of this scale, though not hypergrowth; justifies a premium, but not extreme multiples.                  |
| Current Ratio           | 0.82         | Below 1.0; Apple manages working capital tightly, but no liquidity stress given cash generation and market access.          |
| Debt/Equity             | 1.47         | Moderate leverage; comfortably serviced by cash flow, but higher than some tech peers.                                      |
| Insider Ownership       | 0.10%        | Minimal; typical for a mature mega-cap, not a red flag.                                                                    |
| Insider Transactions    | -1.92%       | Slight net selling; not unusual for execs in a stable, mature company.                                                      |
| Dividend TTM            | 1.01 (0.49%) | Token yield; Apple prioritizes buybacks over dividends, consistent with capital allocation strategy.                        |
| Market Cap              | 3089.63B     | World's largest company; liquidity is unmatched, institutional favorite.                                                    |
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid options and short interest; reflects broad participation and hedging activity.                                |

## 3. Historical Valuation

- **2019:** Average P/E of 18.3
- **2020:** Increased to 33.92

([fullratio.com](https://fullratio.com/stocks/nasdaq-aapl/pe-ratio?utm_source=openai)) This suggests that while the current valuation is elevated compared to historical norms, it has moderated from the 2024 peak.

## 4. Competitor Comparison

A comparison of Apple and its main competitors reveals the following:

| Company   | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| AAPL      | 32.28     | 7.72      | 24.30%        | 3,089.63       |

| META      | 21.91     | N/A       | N/A           | 1,460.30       |

*Note: "N/A" indicates data not provided in the available sources.*

Apple's P/E ratio of 32.28 is higher than that of Microsoft (28.88), Alphabet (16.91), and Meta Platforms (21.91), suggesting a premium valuation relative to these peers.

## 5. Final Recommendation

**Recommendation:** Hold

**Justification:**

Apple's current P/E ratio of 32.28 is elevated compared to its historical average and higher than several key competitors, indicating a premium valuation. Recent regulatory challenges, including significant fines and mandated operational changes, introduce potential risks that could impact future profitability. Additionally, the discontinuation of projects like the electric car and microLED development, leading to substantial layoffs, raises concerns about the company's innovation pipeline.

However, Apple's strong profitability metrics, including a profit margin of 24.30%, and its proactive integration of AI technologies through initiatives like Apple Intelligence, demonstrate resilience and adaptability.

**Investment Outlook:**

Given the current premium valuation and emerging risks, it is prudent to adopt a "Hold" position on Apple stock. Investors should monitor the company's ability to navigate regulatory challenges, the market reception of its AI initiatives, and any further developments in its product pipeline. A more favorable entry point may arise if the stock's valuation aligns more closely with historical averages or if new growth catalysts emerge.
