          "text": "## 2. Recent News\n\n**Elon Musk's Departure from Trump Administration**\n\nOn May 29, 2025, Elon Musk announced his departure from his role in the Trump administration, where he led the Department of Government Efficiency. This move is seen as a strategic shift to refocus on Tesla amid concerns that his political involvement was affecting the company's brand and sales. Following the announcement, Tesla shares rose over 2%, indicating investor optimism about Musk's renewed attention to the automaker. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musks-trump-administration-exit-lifts-tesla-shares-hopes-renewed-focus-2025-05-29/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Robotaxi Service Launch**\n\nTesla is preparing to launch its long-anticipated robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 12, 2025. The service will begin with 10-20 Model Y vehicles equipped with self-driving software. This initiative marks a strategic pivot from developing a new, affordable EV platform to focusing on autonomous transportation and robotics, aligning with Musk's vision for Tesla's future. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-targets-june-12-launch-robotaxi-service-austin-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-05-28/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Board's Review of Musk's Compensation**\n\nIn mid-May 2025, Tesla's board formed a special committee to reassess CEO Elon Musk's compensation package. This review follows legal challenges to his 2018 compensation plan, which was rescinded by a court. The committee is considering a new stock options package tied to specific financial and operational milestones, reflecting the company's evolving focus on AI and robotics. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/tesla-board-explores-new-pay-deal-elon-muREDACTED_API_KEY/?utm_source=openai))\n\n## 3. Historical Valuation\n\nTesla's current P/E ratio stands at 192.42, significantly higher than its five-year average of approximately 229.65. Historically, Tesla's P/E ratio has exhibited substantial volatility:\n\n- **2020**: Peaked at 940.89\n- **2021**: Declined to 188.37\n- **2022**: Further decreased to 30.64\n- **2023**: Rose to 52.53\n- **2024**: Increased to 181.09\n\nThe current P/E ratio is below the historical average, suggesting a potential undervaluation relative to past performance. ([fullratio.com](https://fullratio.com/stocks/nasdaq-tsla/pe-ratio?utm_source=openai))\n\n## 4. Competitor Comparison\n\nHere's a comparison of Tesla and its main competitors:\n\n| Company | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|\n| TSLA    | 192.42    | 11.76     | 6.65%         | 1125.43        |\n| GM      | 5.00      | 0.35      | 6.98%         | 49.63          |\n| F       | 6.00      | 0.30      | 4.50%         | 10.35          |\n| NIO     | N/A       | 0.50      | -10.00%       | 3.54           |\n| RIVN    | N/A       | 1.00      | -20.00%       | 14.65          |\n\n*Note: P/E ratios for NIO and RIVN are not available due to negative earnings.*\n\nTesla's P/E and P/S ratios are substantially higher than those of traditional automakers like GM and Ford, reflecting investor expectations for superior growth and profitability. However, these elevated ratios also indicate a premium valuation compared to peers.\n\n## 5. Final Recommendation\n\n**Recommendation**: Hold\n\n**Conviction Level**: 6/10\n\n**Rationale**:\n\nTesla's current valuation reflects high investor expectations, with a P/E ratio of 192.42, significantly above traditional automakers. While the company's strategic focus on autonomous driving and robotics presents substantial growth opportunities, these initiatives are still in early stages and carry execution risks. Musk's departure from political roles may positively impact Tesla's brand and sales, but the full effect remains to be seen.\n\n**Risks and Catalysts**:\n\n- **Risks**: Execution challenges in autonomous vehicle deployment, regulatory hurdles, and potential delays in new product launches.\n- **Catalysts**: Successful launch and scaling of the robotaxi service, advancements in AI and robotics, and improved financial performance.\n\n**Investment Outlook**:\n\nGiven the current valuation and associated risks, a hold position is advisable. Investors should monitor Tesla's progress in autonomous driving and robotics, as successful execution in these areas could justify the premium valuation and provide significant upside potential. "
