# Apple Inc. (AAPL) Financial Analysis

## Analysis Table

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Valuation & Growth** |
| P/E (TTM) | 30.98 | Significantly above the historical average for Apple (typically 15-25), indicating premium valuation that requires strong future growth to justify. |
| P/S | 7.41 | Very high compared to hardware peers, reflecting investor expectations of continued services growth and premium pricing power. |
| PEG Ratio | 3.71 | Concerning level above 2.0, suggesting the stock may be overvalued relative to its expected growth rate. |
| P/FCF | 30.11 | Elevated multiple that indicates investors are paying a premium for Apple's consistent cash generation capabilities. |
| P/B | 44.40 | Extraordinarily high, though partially explained by Apple's aggressive share repurchase program which reduces book value. |
| **Profitability** |
| ROE | 138.02% | Exceptional return on equity, largely driven by financial engineering through share buybacks that reduce equity base. |
| ROA | 29.10% | Outstanding asset utilization, demonstrating Apple's operational efficiency and premium pricing strategy. |
| Profit Margin | 24.30% | Elite margin profile that significantly outperforms hardware industry averages, reflecting Apple's brand strength and ecosystem advantages. |
| Sales Growth (5Y) | 9.18% | Solid but not exceptional growth for a tech company, highlighting Apple's maturity and massive revenue base. |
| **Liquidity & Leverage** |
| Current Ratio | 0.82 | Below the ideal 1.0 threshold, though less concerning for Apple given its massive cash generation and access to capital markets. |
| Debt/Equity | 1.47 | Moderately leveraged, though Apple's debt is strategic rather than necessary given its enormous cash reserves. |
| **Qualitative Factors** |
| Insider Ownership | 0.10% | Very low insider ownership, typical of mega-cap companies but provides limited alignment with shareholders. |
| Insider Transactions | -3.19% | Net selling by insiders could signal concerns about valuation or future growth prospects. |
| Dividend TTM | 1.00 (0.50%) | Modest yield that suggests Apple prioritizes growth and buybacks over returning cash to shareholders through dividends. |
| Market Cap | 2965.20B | The largest company by market cap globally, indicating both dominance and potential growth constraints due to sheer size. |
| Option/Short | Yes / Yes | High options activity reflects market interest, while short interest suggests some skepticism about current valuation. |

## Final Recommendation

Apple presents a complex investment case with exceptional profitability metrics (138% ROE, 29% ROA, 24.3% profit margin) that are among the best in any industry, counterbalanced by increasingly stretched valuation multiples. The current P/E of 30.98 and PEG of 3.71 are difficult to justify based on the company's 9.18% five-year sales growth rate, suggesting investors are paying a substantial premium for perceived quality and stability.

The company's financial engineering through massive share repurchases has boosted per-share metrics but also contributed to the elevated P/B ratio of 44.40. While Apple's ecosystem, brand strength, and services growth trajectory remain compelling advantages, the insider selling (-3.19%) raises some concerns about near-term upside potential.

**Investment Recommendation**: Apple represents a **HOLD** for existing investors but warrants **CAUTION** for new positions at current valuations. The company's exceptional profitability and ecosystem strength make it a core long-term holding, but new investors should consider dollar-cost averaging or waiting for valuation pullbacks before establishing significant positions. The risk-reward profile appears skewed to the downside in the near term given the premium valuation relative to growth prospects, though Apple's innovation pipeline and services expansion could potentially justify current multiples if successfully executed.
