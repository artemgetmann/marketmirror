* Check historical ratios (p/e,p/s,p/b etc.) of AAPL to see if it's overvalued using Macrotrends
  o It has one of the most accurate P/E ratios
  o If you see low stock price and high P/E means overvalued
  o Check all your other ratios as well, side by side with competitors of your chosen company
* GuruFocus – compare historical ratios, P/E, forward P/E etc. and vs its industry
  o Tells you if overvalued or if there are better companies in the industry
  o Also good for quick analysis of a company, gives you all ratios etc.

* Maybe look into the P/FCF Ratio and DCF
