| Metric                  | Value        | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 33.44       | Elevated but justified by high growth and dominant market position; lower than peak tech bubbles, reasonable for AMZN’s scale.      |
| P/S                     | 3.35        | Attractive for a company with Amazon’s growth and scale; historically low for a tech giant with AWS and retail diversification.     |
| PEG Ratio               | 1.95        | Slightly above the ideal (<1.5), but still indicates growth is priced reasonably given AMZN’s long-term reinvestment strategy.      |
| P/FCF                   | 104.59      | High, reflecting aggressive reinvestment and recent capex; not unusual for Amazon, but signals market expects strong future FCF.    |
| P/B                     | 7.11        | High vs. traditional industries, but typical for asset-light, high-ROE tech; book value less relevant for platform businesses.      |
| ROE                     | 25.24%      | Exceptionally strong, shows Amazon’s ability to compound shareholder capital efficiently.                                           |
| ROA                     | 11.23%      | Robust for a company with Amazon’s asset base; demonstrates efficient use of assets across diverse business lines.                  |
| Profit Margin           | 10.14%      | High for a retailer, boosted by AWS; signals pricing power and operational leverage.                                                |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 18.31%      | Elite for a mega-cap; underscores Amazon’s ability to sustain double-digit growth at massive scale.                                 |
| Current Ratio           | 1.05        | Adequate; covers short-term liabilities, but not a cash-rich fortress. Typical for Amazon’s just-in-time working capital model.     |
| Debt/Equity             | 0.49        | Conservative leverage; Amazon is not overextended, leaving room for strategic investments or buybacks.                              |
| Insider Ownership       | 10.58%      | Very high for a $2T company; strong alignment between leadership and shareholders.                                                  |
| Insider Transactions    | -0.02%      | Flat; no major insider buying or selling, suggests confidence but no urgent undervaluation signal.                                  |
| Dividend TTM            | -           | No dividend; all capital reinvested into growth, consistent with Amazon’s long-term compounding philosophy.                         |
| Market Cap              | 2176.46B    | Among the world’s largest; liquidity and index presence are not in question.                                                        |
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes   | Highly liquid options and active short interest; ideal for tactical positioning and hedging.                                        |

## 2. Recent News

**Regulatory Issues:** Amazon has faced increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies concerning its market practices. In early 2025, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) initiated an antitrust lawsuit alleging that Amazon engaged in anti-competitive behavior by favoring its own products over third-party sellers on its platform. This legal action could lead to significant fines and necessitate changes in Amazon's business operations.

**Layoffs:** In response to economic pressures and a strategic shift towards efficiency, Amazon announced a reduction of approximately 9,000 jobs in March 2025. This move primarily affected roles within its AWS cloud division, advertising, and Twitch streaming service. The layoffs are part of a broader effort to streamline operations and reduce costs amid a challenging macroeconomic environment.

**Management Changes:** Amazon's leadership has seen notable changes, with the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in April 2025. The new CFO brings extensive experience in financial management within the tech industry, signaling Amazon's commitment to strengthening its financial strategy and investor relations.

**Product Launches:** In May 2025, Amazon expanded its hardware lineup by introducing the Echo Vision, a smart display device integrating advanced AI capabilities. This product aims to enhance user interaction through improved voice recognition and personalized content delivery, positioning Amazon competitively in the smart home market.

**Macroeconomic Headwinds:** Amazon continues to navigate challenges posed by global supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. These factors have impacted operational costs and delivery timelines, prompting the company to adjust pricing strategies and invest in logistics infrastructure to mitigate adverse effects.

*Note: Market capitalization values are in billions of USD.*

Compared to its peers, Amazon's P/E ratio is higher than Walmart's and Alphabet's but lower than Apple's and Microsoft's. Its profit margin is competitive, though not as high as Microsoft's or Apple's. The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio indicates that Amazon's stock is valued higher relative to its sales compared to Walmart but lower than Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple.

## 5. Final Recommendation

Amazon's current P/E ratio of 33.44 is below its five-year average, indicating a potentially attractive entry point for investors. The company's recent cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, demonstrate a proactive approach to maintaining profitability amid economic challenges. The introduction of innovative products like the Echo Vision reflects Amazon's commitment to staying at the forefront of technology.

However, the ongoing antitrust lawsuit poses a significant risk that could impact Amazon's operations and financial performance. Investors should monitor the progress of this legal action closely.

**Recommendation:** **Buy**

**Conviction Level:** 8/10

The current valuation, combined with Amazon's strong market position and strategic initiatives, presents a compelling investment opportunity. Investors should remain vigilant regarding regulatory developments and macroeconomic factors that may influence the company's performance.

In summary, Amazon's stock offers a favorable risk-reward profile for investors seeking exposure to a leading technology company with a diversified business model and a track record of innovation.
