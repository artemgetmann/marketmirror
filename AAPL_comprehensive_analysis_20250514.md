Apple's P/E ratio is higher than Microsoft's (28.88), Alphabet's (16.91), and Meta's (21.91), suggesting a premium valuation. The P/S ratio of 7.94 is also elevated, indicating that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of sales compared to its peers.

## 5. Final Recommendation

Apple's financial metrics reflect strong profitability and growth, with a high ROE of 138.02% and a profit margin of 24.30%. However, the current P/E ratio of 33.23 is above its historical average and higher than many competitors, indicating a premium valuation. Recent developments, such as compliance with EU regulations and the acquisition of Pixelmator, demonstrate Apple's adaptability and commitment to innovation.

Given the elevated valuation metrics and recent insider selling activity (-3.19%), investors should exercise caution. While Apple's strong market position and profitability are compelling, the current stock price may already reflect these strengths.

**Investment Outlook:** Hold. Monitor for potential catalysts, such as new product launches or market expansions, that could justify the current valuation. Be aware of risks including regulatory challenges and market competition.
