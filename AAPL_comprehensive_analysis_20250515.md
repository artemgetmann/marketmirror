- **2019:** Average P/E of 18.3
- **2020:** Average P/E of 33.92

## 4. Competitor Comparison

Below is a comparison of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its main competitors:

| Company   | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| AAPL      | 33.05     | 7.90      | 24.30%        | 3,162.66       |
| MSFT      | 28.88     | 12.00     | 34.00%        | 2,790.64       |

*Note: Market capitalization values are approximate and in billions.*

Compared to its peers, Apple's P/E ratio is higher than Microsoft's and Google's but lower than Amazon's. Its Profit Margin is competitive, though slightly lower than Microsoft's. The P/S ratio is higher than Google's but lower than Microsoft's, indicating a relatively higher valuation in terms of sales.

## 5. Final Recommendation

Apple Inc. has demonstrated resilience and adaptability through strategic initiatives such as the introduction of Apple Intelligence and the acquisition of Pixelmator. However, recent layoffs and the termination of Project Titan indicate a shift in focus and potential internal challenges. The transition to a new CFO may introduce short-term uncertainties, though the internal promotion suggests continuity.

The current P/E ratio of 33.72 is above the five-year average, suggesting a premium valuation. While Apple's profitability remains strong, the elevated valuation may limit immediate upside potential.

**Recommendation:** Hold. Investors should monitor the company's execution of its AI initiatives and the impact of management changes. Potential risks include increased competition in the AI space and regulatory challenges. Catalysts for future growth may include successful integration of AI features and expansion into new markets.

In summary, while Apple remains a robust company with promising initiatives, the current valuation suggests a cautious approach. Investors should stay informed about the company's strategic developments and be prepared to adjust their positions accordingly.
