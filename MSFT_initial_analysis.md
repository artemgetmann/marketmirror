| Metric                  | Value         | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 35.53        | Elevated, reflecting investor confidence in durable earnings growth; above S&P 500 average, but justified for tech.  |
| P/S                     | 12.66        | High multiple, but aligns with dominant SaaS/cloud players; indicates strong pricing power and recurring revenue.    |
| PEG Ratio               | 2.45         | Above ideal (<2), suggesting premium pricing relative to growth; market expects sustained innovation and expansion.  |
| P/FCF                   | 49.26        | Expensive on free cash flow, but robust cash generation supports heavy reinvestment and shareholder returns.         |
| P/B                     | 10.62        | High for a mature firm; reflects intangible asset dominance (IP, software, brand) rather than physical assets.       |
| ROE                     | 33.61%       | Exceptional; signals efficient capital use and wide economic moat. Top-tier among mega-cap peers.                    |
| ROA                     | 18.46%       | Strong; demonstrates high asset productivity—rare for a company of this scale.                                       |
| Profit Margin           | 35.79%       | World-class; underscores Microsoft’s pricing power and operational leverage.                                         |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 14.33%       | Solid, especially for a company at this scale; outpaces most legacy tech and large-cap peers.                        |
| Current Ratio           | 1.37         | Healthy liquidity; comfortably covers short-term obligations, typical for mature tech leaders.                       |
| Debt/Equity             | 0.33         | Conservative leverage; ample capacity for strategic M&A or capital returns without financial strain.                 |
| Insider Ownership       | 1.47%        | Modest, but not unusual for mega-caps; aligns interests, but not a major driver at this scale.                       |
| Insider Transactions    | -0.13%       | Slight net selling; not alarming—common for executive compensation diversification.                                  |
| Dividend TTM            | 2.41 (0.52%) | Low yield, but reliable; signals commitment to returning cash while prioritizing growth investments.                 |
| Market Cap              | 3417.11B     | Absolute global behemoth; liquidity and scale unmatched—limits existential risk, but caps “hypergrowth” upside.      |
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid options market; short interest is typical for a mega-cap, not indicative of broad skepticism.          |
