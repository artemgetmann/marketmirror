|-------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| P/S                     | 11.40       | Rich valuation; well above auto industry norms, justified only by tech-like growth and margin potential.           |
| PEG Ratio               | 10.01       | Indicates valuation is high even relative to expected growth; typically <2 is attractive for growth stocks.         |
| P/FCF                   | 160.99      | Expensive on free cash flow; investors are betting on substantial future cash generation.                           |

| Profit Margin           | 6.65%       | Low for a “tech” company, but strong relative to legacy auto; margin expansion is a key upside lever.               |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 34.02%      | Exceptional; outpaces virtually all large-cap peers, justifying premium multiples if sustained.                    |

| Insider Transactions    | -0.22%      | Slight net selling; not alarming, but worth monitoring for trend shifts.                                           |
| Dividend TTM            | -           | No dividend; capital is reinvested for aggressive growth, standard for high-growth disruptors.                     |
| Market Cap              | 1091.49B    | Mega-cap status; liquidity is not a concern, and institutional participation is high.                              |
