| **Metric**             | **Value**      | **Commentary / Assessment**                                                                                                                                           |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)              | 190.53         | Exceptionally high; reflects extreme growth expectations or current earnings suppression. Market is pricing in massive future earnings expansion.                     |
| P/S                    | 11.64          | Rich valuation; investors are paying a premium for each dollar of sales, justified only if sales growth remains exceptional.                                          |
| PEG Ratio              | 10.22          | Very high; indicates price is far above current growth rate. Typically, <2 is attractive. Suggests market expects acceleration or is overpaying for growth.           |
| P/FCF                  | 164.36         | Extremely elevated; signals market is betting on future free cash flow expansion. Not sustainable unless growth re-accelerates.                                      |
| P/B                    | 14.94          | High, but typical for dominant tech names with intangible assets and brand value. Lower in traditional auto, but Tesla is priced as a tech disruptor.                 |
| ROE                    | 9.16%          | Decent, but not extraordinary for a tech leader. Indicates moderate efficiency in generating profit from equity. Room for improvement.                               |
| ROA                    | 5.43%          | Modest; reflects capital intensity of auto manufacturing. Higher would be preferable for a tech-driven business.                                                     |
| Profit Margin          | 6.65%          | Thin, especially versus software peers, but above legacy auto. Shows Tesla’s edge, but leaves little room for error at this valuation.                               |
| Sales Growth (5Y)      | 34.02%         | Outstanding; validates the growth narrative and justifies a premium, but market expects this pace to continue or accelerate.                                         |
| Current Ratio          | 2.00           | Strong liquidity; comfortably covers short-term obligations. Shows financial stability, not at risk of near-term cash crunch.                                        |
| Debt/Equity            | 0.18           | Very low leverage; Tesla has a fortress balance sheet relative to peers. Allows flexibility and resilience during downturns.                                         |
| Insider Ownership      | 12.90%         | High; founder/insider alignment with shareholders is a major positive. Indicates strong internal conviction in long-term prospects.                                  |
| Insider Transactions   | -0.36%         | Slight net selling; not alarming, but worth monitoring for trends. Could be profit-taking or diversification by insiders.                                            |
| Dividend TTM           | -              | No dividend; all capital reinvested for growth. Standard for high-growth disruptors, not a concern for this stage.                                                   |
| Market Cap             | $1,114.39B     | Mega-cap status; liquidity is excellent, and the company is entrenched as a global leader.                                                                          |
| Option/Short           | Yes / Yes      | Robust options market and active short interest; reflects high institutional participation and polarized sentiment.                                                  |
