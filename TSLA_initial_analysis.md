| Metric                   | Value        | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)                | 190.53      | Exceptionally high — reflects extreme growth expectations; market is pricing in future dominance, not current profit. |
| P/S                      | 11.64       | Richly valued; premium multiple vs. auto peers, justified only if hyper-growth continues.                             |
| PEG Ratio                | 10.22       | Indicates price far outpaces expected growth; typically, a PEG near 1 is ideal.                                      |
| P/FCF                    | 164.36      | Very high; market is betting on future cash flow ramp, not current free cash flow generation.                        |
| P/B                      | 14.94       | Substantially above traditional auto industry (often <2); reflects Tesla’s intangible brand and tech premium.         |
| ROE                      | 9.16%       | Solid but not exceptional; lower than some tech giants, but strong for an automaker.                                 |
| ROA                      | 5.43%       | Decent for a capital-intensive business; Tesla’s asset efficiency is improving but not elite.                        |
| Profit Margin            | 6.65%       | Good for an automaker, below top tech firms; shows Tesla is more profitable than legacy peers.                       |
| Sales Growth (5Y)        | 34.02%      | Outstanding — top decile growth, supports the high valuation if this pace is sustainable.                             |
| Current Ratio            | 2.00        | Strong liquidity; well above 1.0, indicating financial flexibility and low short-term risk.                           |
| Debt/Equity              | 0.18        | Very conservative leverage; Tesla’s balance sheet is fortress-like compared to debt-heavy auto industry.              |
| Insider Ownership        | 12.90%      | High; management is heavily invested, aligning interests with shareholders.                                           |
| Insider Transactions     | -0.36%      | Slight net selling; not a major red flag but worth monitoring for trend shifts.                                       |
| Dividend TTM             | -           | No dividend; capital is being reinvested for growth, standard for high-growth tech.                                   |
| Market Cap               | 1114.39B    | Mega-cap status; Tesla is a market leader with global scale and liquidity.                                            |
| Option/Short             | Yes / Yes   | High options activity and short interest; reflects polarized sentiment and trading volatility.                        |
