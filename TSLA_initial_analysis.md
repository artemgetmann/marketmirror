| **P/S**                 | 11.76       | High for an automaker, but in line with premium tech companies. Implies market sees Tesla as more than a car company.        |
| **PEG Ratio**           | 10.32       | Suggests valuation is rich even after accounting for growth; typically <2 is attractive, but Tesla trades on vision premium. |

| **Insider Transactions**| -0.36%      | Slight net selling, but not enough to be concerning given overall high insider ownership and CEO’s unique compensation.       |
| **Dividend TTM**        | -           | No dividend; all capital reinvested for growth, typical for disruptive innovators.                                           |
