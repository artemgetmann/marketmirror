| Metric                  | Value         | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 186.59       | Exceptionally high. Reflects extreme growth expectations; market is pricing in massive future earnings expansion.            |
| P/S                     | 11.40        | Rich valuation. Well above auto industry norms; justified only if Tesla sustains tech-like growth and margins.               |
| PEG Ratio               | 10.01        | Very elevated. Indicates price far outpaces expected growth; usually <2 is attractive, so this is a red flag for valuation. |
| P/FCF                   | 160.97       | Extremely high. Market is paying a significant premium for future cash flows; leaves little margin for error.                |
| P/B                     | 14.64        | Substantially above legacy automakers; signals high expectations for asset-light, tech-driven returns.                       |
| ROE                     | 9.16%        | Modest. Lower than top tech peers, but still healthy for an automaker; room for improvement as scale and margins expand.     |
| ROA                     | 5.43%        | Solid for a capital-intensive business; above most traditional automakers, but below top large-cap tech.                     |
| Profit Margin           | 6.65%        | Decent, but not stellar; reflects recent margin compression and price cuts.                                                  |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 31.78%       | Outstanding. Among the highest in mega-cap stocks; validates the disruptive growth narrative.                                |
| Current Ratio           | 2.00         | Strong liquidity. Ample buffer against short-term obligations; signals prudent balance sheet management.                     |
| Debt/Equity             | 0.18         | Very low leverage. Tesla can weather downturns and invest aggressively without financial strain.                             |
| Insider Ownership       | 12.90%       | High. Indicates strong founder/insider alignment with shareholders; rare for a company of this size.                         |
| Insider Transactions    | -0.36%       | Slight net selling; not unusual at this scale, but worth monitoring for trend shifts.                                        |
| Dividend TTM            | -            | No dividend. All capital plowed back into growth; appropriate for high-growth tech disruptor.                                |
| Market Cap              | 1091.37B     | Mega-cap status. Only a handful of companies in this league; liquidity is not a concern.                                     |
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes    | Highly liquid options market and active short interest; attracts both hedgers and speculators.                               |
