|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)                   | 186.61     | Extremely high; market is pricing in aggressive future growth. Much higher than mature automakers, but typical for tech leaders in high-growth phases. |
| P/S                         | 11.40      | Rich valuation; indicates premium market expectation for future sales expansion and margin improvement.                    |
| PEG Ratio                   | 9.87       | Well above the ideal (<2); signals that current price far outpaces expected earnings growth. High conviction required.     |
| P/FCF                       | 160.99     | Suggests the stock is trading at a significant premium to free cash flow; market confidence in future cash generation.     |
| P/B                         | 14.64      | Reflects strong market belief in Tesla’s intangible assets and future earnings power, not just its book value.             |
| ROE                         | 9.16%      | Solid, but not spectacular for a tech-driven growth story; room for improvement as scale and efficiencies increase.        |
| ROA                         | 5.43%      | Decent asset efficiency; higher than legacy auto peers, but below elite tech firms.                                        |
| Profit Margin               | 6.65%      | Above most traditional automakers, but below top software/tech; shows operating leverage, but still room to expand.        |
| Sales Growth (5Y)           | 34.02%     | Exceptional growth rate; top-tier even among tech giants, justifies premium multiples if sustainable.                      |
| Current Ratio               | 2.00       | Strong liquidity; comfortably covers short-term obligations, reducing bankruptcy risk.                                     |
| Debt/Equity                 | 0.18       | Very low leverage; conservative balance sheet for a growth company, allowing flexibility and resilience.                   |
| Insider Ownership           | 12.90%     | High for a mega-cap; strong alignment with shareholder interests, signals skin in the game.                                |
| Insider Transactions        | -0.22%     | Slight net selling; not alarming, but worth monitoring for shifts in insider conviction.                                   |
| Dividend TTM                | -          | No dividend; standard for high-growth, reinvestment-focused companies.                                                     |
| Market Cap                  | 1091.49B   | Mega-cap size; liquidity and institutional interest are a given, but limits potential for hypergrowth multiples.           |
| Option/Short                | Yes / Yes  | Highly liquid options market; significant short interest can amplify moves during fear or euphoria cycles.                 |
