| Metric                  | Value         | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 186.61       | Extremely high; reflects massive future growth expectations. Market is pricing in sustained innovation and expansion.   |
| P/S                     | 11.40        | Rich multiple; investors are paying a premium for each dollar of sales, typical for disruptive tech leaders.           |
| PEG Ratio               | 10.01        | Significantly above 1; growth is not outpacing valuation, suggesting the stock is expensive relative to near-term EPS growth. |
| P/FCF                   | 160.99       | Very high; market anticipates explosive future free cash flow, but current FCF yield is thin.                          |
| P/B                     | 14.64        | High relative to traditional automakers, but consistent with high-growth tech companies with strong intangible value.   |
| ROE                     | 9.16%        | Respectable but not exceptional; shows decent efficiency in generating profit from equity, lower than top tech peers.  |
| ROA                     | 5.43%        | Moderate; asset utilization is solid, but not standout for a company of Tesla’s market cap and ambition.               |
| Profit Margin           | 6.65%        | Thin for a tech company, but strong for auto industry; reflects ongoing investment and scale-up costs.                 |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 34.02%       | Exceptional; top-tier growth rate, justifying premium multiples if sustained.                                          |
| Current Ratio           | 2.00         | Strong liquidity; Tesla can easily cover short-term obligations, indicating financial flexibility.                     |
| Debt/Equity             | 0.18         | Very low leverage; Tesla is conservatively financed, reducing bankruptcy risk and supporting long-term resilience.      |
| Insider Ownership       | 12.90%       | High; strong alignment with shareholders, founder-led conviction, and skin in the game.                                |
| Insider Transactions    | -0.22%       | Slight net selling; not alarming given executive compensation cycles, but worth monitoring for trend changes.           |
| Dividend TTM            | -            | No dividend; all capital is being reinvested into growth, standard for high-growth disruptors.                         |
| Market Cap              | 1091.49B     | Mega-cap status; liquidity is excellent, and the company is too big to be easily disrupted or threatened with bankruptcy.|
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes    | High option activity and short interest; stock is a battleground, amplifying volatility and potential for mispricing.   |
