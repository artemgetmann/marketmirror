| Metric                | Value        | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                              |
|-----------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)             | 187.34      | Exceptionally high; reflects massive future growth expectations. Market is pricing in years of dominance and innovation.        |
| P/S                   | 11.45       | Rich for auto sector, but justified by tech-like margins and recurring software/services potential.                            |
| PEG Ratio             | 9.58        | Well above 1; signals current price far outpaces expected growth. Market is demanding perfection.                              |
| P/FCF                 | 161.61      | Extremely elevated; cash flow lags earnings due to heavy reinvestment and scaling. Not ideal, but typical for hyper-growth.   |
| P/B                   | 14.69       | Substantially above industry norms; market values Tesla's intangible assets and brand moat highly.                             |
| ROE                   | 9.16%       | Modest for a tech leader, but solid for capital-intensive manufacturing. Room for operational leverage to kick in.             |
| ROA                   | 5.43%       | Average for a company of this scale; efficiency gains likely as global expansion matures.                                      |
| Profit Margin         | 6.65%       | Thin compared to pure tech, but strong for automakers. Margins could expand with software/FSD adoption.                        |
| Sales Growth (5Y)     | 34.02%      | Phenomenal growth; outpaces nearly all large-cap peers. Confirms secular demand and execution strength.                        |
| Current Ratio         | 2.00        | Healthy liquidity; easily covers short-term obligations. No near-term solvency risk.                                           |
| Debt/Equity           | 0.18        | Very conservative leverage; Tesla is not at risk of debt-driven distress.                                                      |
| Insider Ownership     | 12.90%      | Exceptionally high for a mega-cap; strong alignment with shareholders, Musk’s stake is a key signal.                           |
| Insider Transactions  | -0.25%      | Slight net selling; not alarming at this scale, but worth monitoring for trend shifts.                                         |
| Dividend TTM          | -           | No dividend; all capital reinvested for growth, consistent with high-conviction, long-term strategy.                           |
| Market Cap            | 1095.71B    | One of the world’s largest companies; liquidity is never an issue, and institutional interest is high.                         |
| Option/Short          | Yes / Yes   | Robust options market and short interest; volatility remains elevated, enabling asymmetric opportunities during fear spikes.   |
