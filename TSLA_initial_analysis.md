| Metric                   | Value        | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)                | 184.73      | Exceptionally high—reflects extreme growth expectations and market confidence; well above sector average, signals premium pricing.  |
| P/S                       | 11.29       | Elevated for auto sector; justified only if revenue growth remains exponential—shows market's faith in future sales expansion.      |
| PEG Ratio                 | 9.45        | Very high—suggests growth may not currently justify the valuation; typically, a PEG under 1 is attractive for growth stocks.       |
| P/FCF                     | 159.36      | Sky-high—market is pricing in substantial future free cash flow growth; leaves little margin for error in execution.               |
| P/B                       | 14.49       | Far above traditional automakers; indicates market views Tesla as a tech company, not just a carmaker.                             |
| ROE                       | 9.16%       | Respectable but not stellar for a "tech" valuation; traditional auto ROE is often lower, but big tech can exceed 20%.              |
| ROA                       | 5.43%       | Solid for capital-intensive manufacturing; well above legacy automakers, but below top-tier tech firms.                            |
| Profit Margin             | 6.65%       | Margins are thin relative to tech peers, but strong for auto industry; room for improvement as scale and software mix increase.    |
| Sales Growth (5Y)         | 34.02%      | Outstanding—Tesla remains in hypergrowth mode; this is the core justification for its valuation multiples.                        |
| Current Ratio             | 2.00        | Strong liquidity—ample buffer to cover short-term obligations; conservative for a growth company.                                 |
| Debt/Equity               | 0.18        | Very low leverage; conservative capital structure, reduces bankruptcy risk, enables flexibility.                                   |
| Insider Ownership         | 12.90%      | High—aligns management with shareholders, signals conviction from leadership (notably Musk).                                       |
| Insider Transactions      | -0.22%      | Slight net selling; not alarming at this level, but worth monitoring for trend acceleration.                                       |
| Dividend TTM              | -           | No dividend—consistent with reinvestment in growth; appropriate for a high-growth, high-multiple company.                         |
| Market Cap                | 1080.48B    | Mega-cap status—ensures liquidity and institutional interest; reflects global leadership in EV/AI narrative.                      |
| Option/Short              | Yes / Yes   | Highly liquid options and significant short interest—creates potential for volatility and asymmetric moves on news/fear cycles.    |
