|-------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 186.61      | Extremely high; reflects lofty growth expectations. Market is pricing in significant future earnings expansion.     |
| P/S                     | 11.40       | Rich valuation; well above auto industry norms, justified only by tech-like growth and margin potential.           |
| PEG Ratio               | 10.01       | Indicates valuation is high even relative to expected growth; typically <2 is attractive for growth stocks.         |
| P/FCF                   | 160.99      | Expensive on free cash flow; investors are betting on substantial future cash generation.                           |
| P/B                     | 14.64       | Very high; signals market confidence in intangible assets and future innovation, not just book value.               |
| ROE                     | 9.16%       | Decent, but not exceptional for a tech leader; suggests room for operational leverage improvement.                  |
| ROA                     | 5.43%       | Modest; reflects asset-heavy business, but positive and trending higher as scale increases.                        |
| Profit Margin           | 6.65%       | Low for a “tech” company, but strong relative to legacy auto; margin expansion is a key upside lever.               |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 34.02%      | Exceptional; outpaces virtually all large-cap peers, justifying premium multiples if sustained.                    |
| Current Ratio           | 2.00        | Strong liquidity; well above 1, indicating ample short-term financial flexibility.                                 |
| Debt/Equity             | 0.18        | Very low leverage; Tesla is not at risk of solvency issues, gives room for further investment or downturns.         |
| Insider Ownership       | 12.90%      | High; strong alignment between management and shareholders, rare among mega-caps.                                  |
| Insider Transactions    | -0.22%      | Slight net selling; not alarming, but worth monitoring for trend shifts.                                           |
| Dividend TTM            | -           | No dividend; capital is reinvested for aggressive growth, standard for high-growth disruptors.                     |
| Market Cap              | 1091.49B    | Mega-cap status; liquidity is not a concern, and institutional participation is high.                              |
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes   | Heavily traded in options and shorted; volatility is elevated, but also provides fuel for rapid sentiment shifts.  |

## 2. Recent News

**Regulatory Issues:**

In December 2024, the Trump transition team proposed eliminating a car-crash reporting requirement, a move supported by Tesla. This requirement mandated automakers to report crashes involving advanced driver-assistance or autonomous-driving systems to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Critics argue that removing this requirement could impede the government's ability to monitor and ensure vehicle safety.

**Layoffs:**

In April 2024, Tesla announced a 10% reduction in its workforce, aiming to streamline operations and reduce costs amid declining sales and macroeconomic challenges. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla%2C_Inc.?utm_source=openai))

**Management Changes:**

Facing criticism and falling sales, CEO Elon Musk announced in April 2025 that he would reduce his involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to focus more on Tesla and his other companies. This decision followed investor concerns about Musk's political involvement affecting Tesla's brand and sales.

**Product Launches:**

In November 2024, Tesla began shipping the Cybertruck, produced at Gigafactory Texas. Additionally, in October 2024, the company unveiled concept versions of two autonomous vehicles—the Cybercab and Robovan—intended to be part of a future Tesla ride-hailing service called the Tesla Network. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla%2C_Inc.?utm_source=openai))

**Earnings Surprises:**

In the first quarter of 2025, Tesla's auto revenue declined by 20%, and net profit dropped 71%, missing Wall Street estimates. The company cited difficulties in forecasting growth due to shifting global trade policies and increasing U.S.-China tariffs, which led to suspended orders in China.

## 3. Historical Valuation

Tesla's current P/E ratio stands at 186.61, according to Finviz. Historically, Tesla's P/E ratios have exhibited significant volatility:

- **December 2024:** 197.96
- **December 2023:** 57.65
- **December 2022:** 34.00
- **December 2021:** 215.67
- **December 2020:** 1127.63

The current P/E ratio of 186.61 is slightly below the December 2024 value but significantly higher than the December 2023 and 2022 figures. This suggests that while Tesla's valuation has moderated from its peak in 2020, it remains elevated compared to more recent years.

## 4. Competitor Comparison

Below is a comparison of Tesla and its main competitors:

| Company | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| TSLA    | 186.61    | 11.40     | 6.65%         | 1091.49        |
| GM      | 5.92      | 0.31      | 5.49%         | 48.69          |
| F       | 6.89      | 0.28      | 4.85%         | 10.36          |
| NIO     | N/A       | 0.85      | -29.68%       | 3.82           |
| RIVN    | N/A       | 1.20      | -100.00%      | 15.63          |

*Note: P/E ratios for NIO and Rivian are not available due to negative earnings.*

Tesla's P/E and P/S ratios are substantially higher than those of traditional automakers like General Motors and Ford, indicating a premium valuation. While Tesla's profit margin is slightly higher, the disparity in valuation metrics suggests that the market anticipates significantly higher growth and profitability from Tesla compared to its competitors.

## 5. Final Recommendation

Tesla's current valuation reflects high market expectations, with a P/E ratio of 186.61 and a P/S ratio of 11.40, significantly surpassing traditional automakers. Recent developments, including workforce reductions, management refocusing, and new product launches, indicate proactive measures to address operational challenges and market dynamics.

However, the company's exposure to regulatory changes, geopolitical tensions, and macroeconomic uncertainties introduces risks that could impact future performance. Given the elevated valuation and associated risks, a **hold** recommendation is prudent at this time. Investors should monitor Tesla's execution on new product initiatives, regulatory developments, and competitive positioning to assess future growth prospects.
