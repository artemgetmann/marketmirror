| Metric                  | Value        | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)               | 33.44       | Elevated but justified by high growth and dominant market position; lower than peak tech bubbles, reasonable for AMZN’s scale.      |
| P/S                     | 3.35        | Attractive for a company with Amazon’s growth and scale; historically low for a tech giant with AWS and retail diversification.     |
| PEG Ratio               | 1.95        | Slightly above the ideal (<1.5), but still indicates growth is priced reasonably given AMZN’s long-term reinvestment strategy.      |
| P/FCF                   | 104.59      | High, reflecting aggressive reinvestment and recent capex; not unusual for Amazon, but signals market expects strong future FCF.    |
| P/B                     | 7.11        | High vs. traditional industries, but typical for asset-light, high-ROE tech; book value less relevant for platform businesses.      |
| ROE                     | 25.24%      | Exceptionally strong, shows Amazon’s ability to compound shareholder capital efficiently.                                           |
| ROA                     | 11.23%      | Robust for a company with Amazon’s asset base; demonstrates efficient use of assets across diverse business lines.                  |
| Profit Margin           | 10.14%      | High for a retailer, boosted by AWS; signals pricing power and operational leverage.                                                |
| Sales Growth (5Y)       | 18.31%      | Elite for a mega-cap; underscores Amazon’s ability to sustain double-digit growth at massive scale.                                 |
| Current Ratio           | 1.05        | Adequate; covers short-term liabilities, but not a cash-rich fortress. Typical for Amazon’s just-in-time working capital model.     |
| Debt/Equity             | 0.49        | Conservative leverage; Amazon is not overextended, leaving room for strategic investments or buybacks.                              |
| Insider Ownership       | 10.58%      | Very high for a $2T company; strong alignment between leadership and shareholders.                                                  |
| Insider Transactions    | -0.02%      | Flat; no major insider buying or selling, suggests confidence but no urgent undervaluation signal.                                  |
| Dividend TTM            | -           | No dividend; all capital reinvested into growth, consistent with Amazon’s long-term compounding philosophy.                         |
| Market Cap              | 2176.46B    | Among the world’s largest; liquidity and index presence are not in question.                                                        |
| Option/Short            | Yes / Yes   | Highly liquid options and active short interest; ideal for tactical positioning and hedging.                                        |
