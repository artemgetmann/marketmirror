| Metric                     | Value       | Commentary / Qualitative Assessment                                                                                      |
|----------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P/E (TTM)                  | 17.06       | Reasonable multiple for a value play; not stretched, suggesting limited hype or growth premium.                         |
| P/S                        | 0.54        | Deep value territory; market is pricing revenue cheaply, possibly due to sector or company-specific fear.               |
| PEG Ratio                  | N/A         | Lack of PEG signals unclear growth expectations; market may be ignoring growth potential or it's not well-defined.      |
| P/FCF                      | 6.03        | Strong free cash flow yield; indicates undervaluation and healthy cash generation relative to price.                    |
| P/B                        | 1.09        | Near book value; market not assigning much premium, typical for stable, asset-heavy businesses.                        |
| ROE                        | 6.56%       | Modest; not a high-return machine, but respectable for a mature, capital-intensive industry.                           |
| ROA                        | 3.21%       | Low, but in line with companies with significant asset bases; not a red flag, but not a growth story either.            |
| Profit Margin              | 3.22%       | Thin margins reflect competitive or commoditized business, but positive and stable.                                     |
| Sales Growth (5Y)          | 9.06%       | Surprisingly solid growth for a value stock; market may be underestimating long-term demand.                            |
| Current Ratio              | 2.87        | Excellent liquidity; company can easily cover short-term obligations, reducing bankruptcy risk.                         |
| Debt/Equity                | 0.76        | Moderate leverage; not excessive, but worth monitoring if rates rise or cash flows falter.                              |
| Insider Ownership          | 3.84%       | Decent alignment with shareholders; insiders have skin in the game, but not a controlling stake.                        |
| Insider Transactions       | 0.00%       | No recent insider activity; neutral, but no strong bullish or bearish signals from management.                          |
| Dividend TTM               | No Dividend | No income stream; pure capital appreciation play, may deter dividend-focused investors.                                 |
| Market Cap                 | 1.59B       | Solid mid-cap size; liquid enough for institutional interest, not easily manipulated.                                   |
| Option/Short               | Yes / Yes   | Options market exists, providing hedging and speculation opportunities; short interest may signal skepticism or fear.    |
