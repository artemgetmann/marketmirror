| PEG Ratio             | 3.82        | Well above 1; indicates growth is priced at a steep premium. Not a "growth at a reasonable price" play right now.     |

| P/B                   | 44.19       | Exceptionally high; Apple’s value is in intangible assets, not book value. Typical for mature, high-margin tech.      |
| ROE                   | 138.02%     | Outstanding. Massive returns on equity, supercharged by buybacks and high-margin business.                            |

## 2. Recent News

**Profit Growth Concerns:** In April 2024, UBS Global Research downgraded Apple, along with other major tech companies, from 'Overweight' to 'Neutral.' They projected a decline in earnings per share (EPS) growth from 42.2% in Q1 2024 to 15.5% in Q1 2025, attributing this to challenging comparisons and cyclical factors rather than overvaluation or AI-related doubts.

**Market Volatility:** By April 2025, the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, including Apple, experienced a modest rebound after a sharp decline earlier in the year. This volatility was driven by investor concerns over tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Despite the recovery, these stocks faced scrutiny due to rising valuations and narrowing earnings advantages, with upcoming earnings reports set to test the sustainability of this bounce.

## 3. Historical Valuation

Apple's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio has fluctuated over the past five years:

- **2019:** Ranged from 15.32 to 22.49
- **2020:** Peaked at 35.18
- **2021:** Varied between 24.74 and 28.96
- **2022:** Dropped to a low of 21.83
- **2023:** Climbed back to 29.88
- **2024:** Reached 39.75 by year-end

As of March 18, 2025, the P/E ratio stands at 35.45. ([macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio?utm_source=openai)) This current valuation is above the five-year average, indicating a premium compared to historical norms.

## 4. Competitor Comparison

Here's a comparison of Apple and its main competitors:

| Company | P/E Ratio | P/S Ratio | Profit Margin | Market Cap (B) |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| AAPL    | 30.83     | 7.37      | 24.30%        | 2950.72        |
| MSFT    | 30.61     | 10.85     | 29.23%        | 3126.00        |
| CSCO    | 26.42     | 4.50      | 29.23%        | 99.90          |
| INTC    | N/A       | N/A       | 29.23%        | N/A            |

*Note: Intel's P/E and P/S ratios are not available due to negative earnings.*

Compared to Microsoft, Apple has a slightly higher P/E ratio but a lower P/S ratio, suggesting a more favorable valuation relative to sales. However, Microsoft's higher profit margin indicates better profitability. Cisco's lower P/E and P/S ratios may reflect a more conservative valuation, but its smaller market cap and different business focus make direct comparisons less straightforward.

## 5. Final Recommendation

**Recommendation:** Hold

**Conviction Level:** 6/10

**Justification:**

Apple's current P/E ratio of 35.45 is above its five-year average, suggesting a premium valuation. While the company maintains strong profitability and a dominant market position, recent downgrades and market volatility introduce caution. The projected decline in EPS growth and potential macroeconomic headwinds, such as tariff concerns, could impact future performance.

**Risks and Catalysts:**

- **Risks:** Continued trade tensions and tariffs may affect supply chains and consumer demand. Additionally, a slowdown in profit growth could lead to further valuation adjustments.

- **Catalysts:** Successful product launches, expansion into new markets, and advancements in technology (e.g., AI integration) could drive future growth.

**Investment Outlook:**

Given the current premium valuation and potential headwinds, a cautious approach is warranted. Investors should monitor upcoming earnings reports and macroeconomic developments closely. Maintaining a hold position allows for flexibility to capitalize on potential dips or positive catalysts in the near future.
